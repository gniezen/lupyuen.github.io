_PineCone BL602 RISC-V Board with Grove E-Ink Display_

Is there a book about the __BL602 / BL604 SoC__ (RISC-V, WiFi and Bluetooth LE) that...

1.  Explains in depth the __features of BL602 and BL604__

1.  Has plenty of __annotated sample code,__ with real use cases

1.  Is __open source,__ free to browse and reproduce?

_You're reading the book right now!_

Use this book to navigate the numerous BL602 / BL604 articles that have been published on this site. __(27 articles and still growing!)__

The programs in these articles have been tested on __PineCone__, but they should work on other __BL602 and BL604 Boards: PineDio Stack (BL604), Pinenut, DT-BL10, MagicHome BL602__.

Many thanks to __Pine64__ for supporting my work on BL602 Open Source Education! Thanks also to __Bouffalo Lab__ for the encouraging notes.

If you find this book useful... [__please sponsor me a coffee__](https://github.com/sponsors/lupyuen). Thank you! üôè üòÄ
