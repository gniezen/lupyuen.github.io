_PineCone BL602 RISC-V Board with Grove E-Ink Display_

Is there a book about the __BL602 SoC__ (RISC-V, WiFi and Bluetooth LE) that...

1.  Explains in depth the __features of BL602__

1.  Has lots of __annotated sample code,__ with real use cases

1.  Is __open source,__ free to browse and reproduce?

_You're reading the book right now!_

Use this book to navigate the numerous BL602 articles that have been published on this site. (11 articles and still growing!)

The programs in these articles have been tested on __PineCone__, but they should work on other BL602 Boards: __Pinenut, DT-BL10, MagicHome BL602__.

Many thanks to __Pine64__ for supporting my work on BL602 Open Source Education! Thanks also to __Bouffalo Lab__ for the encouraging notes.
