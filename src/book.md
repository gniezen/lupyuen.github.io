_PineCone BL602 RISC-V Board with Grove E-Ink Display_

Is there a book about the __BL602 SoC__ (RISC-V, WiFi and Bluetooth LE) that...

1.  Explains in depth the __features of BL602__

1.  Has lots of BL602 __annotated sample code,__ with real use cases

1.  Is __open source,__ free to browse and reproduce?

_You're reading it right now!_

Use this book to navigate the numerous BL602 articles that have published on this site. (11 articles and still growing!)

Many thanks to __Pine64__ for supporting my work on BL602 Open Source Education! Thanks also to __Bouffalo Lab__ for the encouraging notes.

The code in these articles have been tested on __PineCone__, but they should work on other BL602 Boards: __Pinenut, DT-BL10, MagicHome BL602__.

# Introduction to BL602

Find out what's inside the BL602 System-on-a-Chip (SoC)... And why it's unique among the microcontrollers we've been using.
