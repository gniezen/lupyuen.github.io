# Understanding PinePhone's Display (MIPI DSI)

üìù _7 Oct 2022_

![PinePhone's LCD Display in the PinePhone Block Diagram](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/dsi-title.jpg)

How does [__Pine64 PinePhone__](https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/PinePhone) control its __LCD Display__?

Let's uncover all the secrets about PinePhone's mysterious LCD Display and its __MIPI Digital Serial Interface__...

-   What's a MIPI Digital Serial Interface (DSI)

-   What's inside PinePhone's LCD Display

-   How it's similar to PineTime's ST7789 Display Controller

-   One lane for Commands, but 4 lanes for Data!

-   Implications of a RAM-less Display Controller

-   What is PinePhone's Timing Controller (TCON)

_Why are we doing this?_

We're now porting [__Apache NuttX RTOS__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/uboot) to PinePhone.

But it will look awfully dull until we __render something__ on PinePhone's LCD Display!

That's why we're probing the internals of PinePhone to create a __NuttX Display Driver__.

We'll come back to this. Let's continue the journey from our __NuttX Porting Journal__...

_PineTime Smartwatch with ST7789 Display Controller_

# From PineTime To PinePhone

_Why PineTime Smartwatch? Is it really similar to PinePhone's Display?_

Sounds unbelievable, but PineTime's __ST7789 Display Controller__ has plenty in common with PinePhone's Display!

(Think of PinePhone as a Super-Sized PineTime)

In this article we shall explain PinePhone's Display by __comparing it with PineTime__.

A quick recap of __PineTime's ST7789 Display__...

-   PineTime talks to its display over SPI (single data lane)...

    [__"Connect ST7789 Display"__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/st7789#connect-st7789-display)

    (We'll soon see that PinePhone talks to its display over 4 data lanes)

-   PineTime uses an extra pin to indicate whether it's sending Commands or Data

    [__"ST7789 Data / Command Pin"__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/st7789#st7789-data--command-pin)

    (PinePhone won't need this)

-   At startup, PineTime sends an Initialisation Sequence of Commands to initialise the display...

    [__"Initialise The Display"__](https://lupyuen.github.io/pinetime-rust-mynewt/articles/mcuboot#initialise-the-display)

    (PinePhone will send a similar Initialisation Sequence)

-   PineTime renders a rectangular chunk of the display at a time...

    [__"Draw A Line"__](https://lupyuen.github.io/pinetime-rust-mynewt/articles/mcuboot#draw-a-line)

    (PinePhone will refresh its entire display continously)

If we're not familiar with PineTime's ST7789 Display, please read the docs above!

_We've read the docs, can we move on?_

OK great! To understand how PinePhone's Display differs from PineTime, we begin with the schematic...

![LCD Display on PinePhone Schematic (Page 2)](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/dsi-title.jpg)

[_LCD Display on PinePhone Schematic (Page 2)_](https://files.pine64.org/doc/PinePhone/PinePhone%20v1.2b%20Released%20Schematic.pdf)

# PinePhone Schematic

Let's turn to Page 2 of the __PinePhone Schematic__ to understand how PinePhone's Display is connected...

-   [__PinePhone Schematic__](https://files.pine64.org/doc/PinePhone/PinePhone%20v1.2b%20Released%20Schematic.pdf)  

From the pic above, we see that the LCD Display is connected to the Allwinner A64 SoC via a __MIPI Digital Serial Interface (DSI)__.

[(MIPI is the __Mobile Industry Processor Interface Alliance__)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPI_Alliance)

_What's a MIPI Digital Serial Interface?_

Think of it as SPI, but supercharged with __Multiple Data Lanes__!

The (dull) technical details of DSI are covered here...

-   [__Display Serial Interface (DSI)__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_Serial_Interface)

But if we're seeking a gentler intro to DSI, please follow me to the next section...

![_MIPI DSI Connector on PinePhone Schematic (Page 11)_](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/dsi-connector.png)

[_MIPI DSI Connector on PinePhone Schematic (Page 11)_](https://files.pine64.org/doc/PinePhone/PinePhone%20v1.2b%20Released%20Schematic.pdf)

# Connector for MIPI DSI

_How shall we learn about MIPI DSI?_

We'll learn plenty about MIPI DSI (Display Serial Interface)... Just by looking at __PinePhone's Connector for the LCD Display__!

Flip to Page 11 of the [__PinePhone Schematic__](https://files.pine64.org/doc/PinePhone/PinePhone%20v1.2b%20Released%20Schematic.pdf) and we'll see the __MIPI DSI Connector__. (Pic above)

The MIPI DSI Connector connects PinePhone's __Allwinner A64 SoC__ directly to the LCD Display. In the pic above we see these connections...

-   __CKN and CKP__ are the DSI Clock Lines

    (Similar to SPI Clock)

-   __D0P and D0N__ for DSI Data Lane 0

    (Similar to SPI MISO / MOSI)

-   __D1P and D1P__ for DSI Data Line 1

    (Yep DSI has more data lanes than SPI)

-   __D2P and D2P__ for DSI Data Line 2

-   __D3P and D3P__ for DSI Data Line 3

    (DSI has 4 data lanes!)

_Why the N and P?_

Because P=NP... Kidding!

__N__ means Negative, __P__ means Positive.

This means that DSI uses [__Differential Signalling__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_signalling) for high-speed data transfers. (4.5 Gbps per lane)

(Differential Signalling is also used in [__HDMI__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI) and [__USB__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB#Signaling))

Let's dig deeper into MIPI DSI...

![Xingbangda XBD599 in PinePhone's Linux Device Tree](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/dsi-lcd.png)

[_Xingbangda XBD599 in PinePhone's Linux Device Tree_](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/pio#mipi-dsi-interface)

# Xingbangda XBD599 LCD Panel

_What's connected to this MIPI DSI Connector?_

The [__Linux Device Tree__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/pio#appendix-pinephone-device-tree) describes everything about PinePhone Hardware in a single text file. Let's snoop around the Device Tree!

First we follow these steps to dump PinePhone's Linux Device Tree in text format...

-   [__"PinePhone Device Tree"__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/pio#appendix-pinephone-device-tree)

Then we search for __MIPI DSI__ in the Device Tree...

-   [__PinePhone Device Tree: sun50i-a64-pinephone-1.2.dts__](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-nuttx/blob/main/sun50i-a64-pinephone-1.2.dts)

From the pic above we see that PinePhone's MIPI DSI Connector is connected to [__Xingbangda XBD599__](https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/dri-devel/patch/20200311163329.221840-4-icenowy@aosc.io/).

This is a 5.99-inch 720x1440 MIPI DSI IPS LCD Panel.

But what's super interesting is that Xingbangda XBD599 has a __Sitronix ST7703 LCD Controller__ inside!

-   [__Sitronix ST7703 LCD Controller Datasheet__](https://files.pine64.org/doc/datasheet/pinephone/ST7703_DS_v01_20160128.pdf)

Let's probe deeper...

![PineTime (ST7789) vs PinePhone (ST7703)](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/dsi-sitronix2.png)

[_PineTime (ST7789) vs PinePhone (ST7703)_](https://www.sitronix.com.tw/en/products/aiot-device-ddi/)

# Sitronix ST7703 LCD Controller

_Sitronix ST7703 sounds familiar?_

Yep Sitronix makes the LCD Controllers for BOTH PineTime and PinePhone!

In fact they're from the [__same family__](https://www.sitronix.com.tw/en/products/aiot-device-ddi/) of LCD Controllers. (ST7789 vs ST7703)

Just that PineTime uses an SPI Interface while PinePhone uses a __MIPI DSI Interface__. (Pic above)

The resolutions are different too. PinePhone has a __huge display__ with more colours...

![PineTime (ST7789) vs PinePhone (ST7703)](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/dsi-sitronix1.png)

[(Source)](https://www.sitronix.com.tw/en/products/aiot-device-ddi/)

Which means that PinePhone's LCD Controller is __RAM-less__...

It __doesn't have any RAM__ inside to remember the pixels. (Unlike PineTime)

_What's the implication of a RAM-less display?_

Because PinePhone's LCD Controller doesn't have any RAM inside to remember the pixels drawn...

PinePhone's A64 SoC will __pump a constant stream of pixels__ to refresh the display.

(Yep PinePhone is way more complicated than PineTime!)

This pixel pumping is done by A64's [__Timing Controller (TCON0)__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/pio#lcd-controller-tcon0). We'll come back to this.

# Initialise LCD Controller

_What happens inside PinePhone's ST7703 LCD Controller?_

Let's figure out by looking at the initialisation of PinePhone's ST7703 LCD Controller.

Xingbangda has provided an [__Initialisation Sequence__](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/drivers/gpu/drm/panel/panel-sitronix-st7703.c#L174-L333) of ST7703 Commands that we should send to the LCD Controller at startup...

| Byte | Purpose |
|:----:|:---------|
| `B9` | __SETEXTC:__ Enable USER Command (Page 131)
| `F1` | - Enable USER Command
| `12` | - (Continued)
| `83` | - (Continued)
| `BA` | __SETMIPI:__ Set MIPI Registers (Page 144)
| `33` | - Virtual Channel (0), Number of Lanes (4)
| `81` | - LDO Voltage, Terminal Resistance
| `05` | - MIPI Low High Speed driving ability
| `F9` | - TXCLK speed in DSI LP mode
| `0E` | - Minimum HFP number
| `0E` | - Minimum HBP number
| ...  | [(And many more commands, see this list)](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/drivers/gpu/drm/panel/panel-sitronix-st7703.c#L174-L333)

The above commands are (mostly) documented in the ST7703 Datasheet...

-   [__Sitronix ST7703 LCD Controller Datasheet__](https://files.pine64.org/doc/datasheet/pinephone/ST7703_DS_v01_20160128.pdf)

_How shall we send the Init Sequence to ST7703?_

We'll send the Command Bytes to ST7703 via a MIPI DSI Display Command: __DCS Long Write__. Which we'll explain next...

![MIPI DSI Display Command Set from A31 User Manual (Page 837)](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/dsi-datatype.png)

[_MIPI DSI Display Command Set from A31 User Manual (Page 837)_](https://github.com/allwinner-zh/documents/raw/master/A31/A31_User_Manual_v1.3_20150510.pdf)

# Display Command Set for MIPI DSI

MIPI Digital Serial Interface (DSI) defines a standard list of commands for controlling the display: __DSI Display Command Set (DCS)__. (Pic above)

To send the Initialisation Sequence to ST7703, we shall transmit the __DCS Long Write__ command. (Data Type `0x39`)

TODO

> DSI-compliant peripherals support either of two basic modes of operation: Command Mode and Video Mode. Which mode is used depends on the architecture and capabilities of the peripheral. The ST7703 only support Video mode. 

> Video Mode refers to operation in which transfers from the host processor to the peripheral take the form of a real-time pixel stream. In normal operation, the driver IC relies on the host processor to provide image data at sufficient bandwidth to avoid flicker or other visible artifacts in the displayed image. Video information should only be transmitted using High Speed Mode.

ST7789 is closest

[st7789.c](https://github.com/lupyuen/incubator-nuttx/blob/master/drivers/lcd/st7789.c)

Init the display first

Maybe the display will light up (backlight)

Then try to draw some pixels

TCON might be harder

[u/immibis](https://www.reddit.com/user/immibis/)

> I had a go. I was able to instruct the MIPI DSI to run commands (by copying from Linux) but I wasn't able to receive a response from the screen. Chat reckons that simply doesn't work. I get the impression what's in Linux might be just a translated version of the BSP SDK and nobody really knows how it works.

> I ordered a Pine A64 and official touchscreen. Same chip (maybe not the same screen) and should be less fiddly to debug with an oscilloscope.

> MIPI DSI registers are partially documented in the sun6i (whichever chip that is) user manual. I got this hint because the Linux driver files are called sun6i even though the chip is actually sun8i.

> To actually display pixels on the screen you also need to program DE and TCON. I saw something somewhere about a test pattern that might be able to bypass this, and a framebuffer mode that bypasses the mixing IIRC.
