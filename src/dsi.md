# Understanding PinePhone's Display (MIPI DSI)

üìù _7 Oct 2022_

![PinePhone's LCD Display](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/dsi-title.jpg)

How does [__Pine64 PinePhone__](https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/PinePhone) control its __LCD Display__?

Let's uncover all the secrets about PinePhone's mysterious LCD Display and its __MIPI Digital Serial Interface__!

-   What's a MIPI Digital Serial Interface (DSI)

-   What's inside PinePhone's LCD Display

-   How is it similar to PineTime's ST7789 Display Controller

-   One lane for Commands, but 4 lanes for Data!

-   Implications of a RAM-less Display Controller

-   What is PinePhone's Timing Controller (TCON)

_Why are we doing this?_

TODO

We're now porting [__Apache NuttX RTOS__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/uboot) to PinePhone
But it wouldn't be interesting
Until we show something on the display!
Creating a NuttX Driver
We'll come back to this

Let's continue the journey from our __NuttX Porting Journal__...

# Before We Start

TODO

Monstrously complicated
today we shall uncover the mysteries
Supersized version of ST7789

st7789 articles
easier to understand
Start with pinetime and pinedio stack bl604
St7789

# What's Next

TODO

And eventually we shall build NuttX Drivers for PinePhone's [__LCD Display__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/pio#lcd-controller-tcon0) and [__Touch Panel__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/pio#touch-panel)!

There's plenty to be done for NuttX on PinePhone, please lemme know if you would like to join me üôè
