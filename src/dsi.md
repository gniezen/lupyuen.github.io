# Understanding PinePhone's Display (MIPI DSI)

üìù _7 Oct 2022_

![PinePhone's LCD Display in the PinePhone Block Diagram](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/dsi-title.jpg)

How does [__Pine64 PinePhone__](https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/PinePhone) control its __LCD Display__?

Let's uncover all the secrets about PinePhone's mysterious LCD Display and its __MIPI Digital Serial Interface__!

-   What's a MIPI Digital Serial Interface (DSI)

-   What's inside PinePhone's LCD Display

-   How it's similar to PineTime's ST7789 Display Controller

-   One lane for Commands, but 4 lanes for Data!

-   Implications of a RAM-less Display Controller

-   What is PinePhone's Timing Controller (TCON)

_Why are we doing this?_

We're now porting [__Apache NuttX RTOS__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/uboot) to PinePhone.

But it will look awfully dull until we __render something__ on PinePhone's LCD Display!

That's why we're probing the internals of PinePhone to create a __NuttX Display Driver__.

We'll come back to this. Let's continue the journey from our __NuttX Porting Journal__...

# From PineTime To PinePhone

_Why PineTime Smartwatch? Is it really similar to PinePhone's Display?_

Sounds unbelievable, but PineTime's __ST7789 Display Controller__ has plenty in common with PinePhone's Display!

TODO

The same ST7789 Display Controller is found in Pine64's PineDio Stack BL604...

Init Commands

SPI: Data / Command

One Lane for Data and Commands

RAM vs RAM-less

Monstrously complicated
today we shall uncover the mysteries
Supersized version of ST7789

# What's Next

TODO

And eventually we shall build NuttX Drivers for PinePhone's [__LCD Display__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/pio#lcd-controller-tcon0) and [__Touch Panel__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/pio#touch-panel)!

There's plenty to be done for NuttX on PinePhone, please lemme know if you would like to join me üôè
