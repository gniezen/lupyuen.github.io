# What's Next

TODO

We have come a loooong way since I first [__experimented with LoRa in 2016__](https://github.com/lupyuen/LoRaArduino)...

- __Cheaper Transceivers__: Shipped overnight from Thailand!

- __Mature Networks__: LoRaWAN, The Things Network

- __Better Drivers__: Thanks to Apache Mynewt OS!

- __Powerful Microcontrollers__: Arduino Uno vs RISC-V BL602

- __Awesome Tools__: RAKwireless WisBlock, Airspy SDR, RF Explorer

Now is the __right time to build LoRa gadgets.__ Stay tuned for more LoRa Adventures!
