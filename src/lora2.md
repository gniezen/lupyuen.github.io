# PineCone BL602 RISC-V Board Receives LoRa Packets

üìù _31 Mar 2021_

Not too long ago (and not so far away) we embarked on an epic quest to create a low-power, long-range [__LoRa IoT Sensor__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoRa) with [__PineCone BL602 RISC-V Board__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/pinecone)

1.  We created a __LoRa Transmitter__ with BL602...

    [__"Connect PineCone BL602 to LoRa Transceiver"__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/lora)

1.  Then we tested it with a __LoRa Receiver__: RAKwireless WisBlock...

    [__"RAKwireless WisBlock talks LoRa with PineCone BL602 RISC-V Board"__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/wisblock)

Today we shall create the LoRa Firmware for BL602 that will __Receive LoRa Packets__. And test it with RAKwireless WisBlock as the LoRa Transmitter.

_Why do we need to receive LoRa Packets... If our BL602 LoRa Sensor will only transmit sensor data?_

Because we'll soon connect our BL602 LoRa Sensor to a __secure, managed LoRaWAN Network__ like [__The Things Network__](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/). (Or maybe [__Helium__](https://www.helium.com/lorawan))

Our BL602 gadget can't join these networks unless it can receive packets and respond to the network.

Let's make it so! (Because we do... Or do not... There is no try!)

The LoRa Firmware in this article will run on __PineCone, Pinenut and Any BL602 Board__.

# Connect BL602 to LoRa Transceiver

Connect BL602 to Semtech SX1276 or Hope RF96 as follows...

Here's a closer look at the pins connected on BL602...

![PineCone BL602 RISC-V Board connected to Hope RF96 LoRa Transceiver](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/lora2-connect4.jpg)

_Why is BL602 Pin 2 unused?_

__`GPIO 2`__ is the __Unused SPI Chip Select__ on BL602.

We won't use this pin because we'll control Chip Select ourselves on `GPIO 14`. [(See this)](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/spi#control-our-own-chip-select-pin)

Here are the pins connected on our LoRa Transceiver: SX1276 or RF96...

(`ISO` and `OSI` appear flipped in this pic... Rotate your phone / computer screen 180 degrees for the proper perspective)

![PineCone BL602 RISC-V Board connected to Hope RF96 LoRa Transceiver](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/lora2-connect5.jpg)

_Why do we connect so many pins on SX1276 (or RF96)?_

The SX1276 and RF96 transceivers have __6 (!) Digital Input / Output pins: `DIO0` to `DIO5`__

The transceiver shifts the Logic Levels of these pins from __Low to High__ when specific conditions occur...

-   __`DIO0` Packet Received__: This pin is triggered when the transceiver __receives a LoRa Packet.__

    `DIO0` is also triggered after the transceiver has transmitted a LoRa Packet, but that's not so useful.

-   __`DIO1` Receive Timeout__: This pin is triggered when the transceiver __doesn't receive any LoRa Packets__ within a timeout window.

    This works only when the transceiver is configured for __Single Receive Mode__.

    However today we're configuring our transceiver for __Continuous Receive Mode__ so we won't be using `DIO1`. We shall trigger receive timeouts with a BL602 Timer.

-   __`DIO2` Change Channel__: This is used for __Spread Spectrum Transmission__ (Frequency Hopping). 

    When we transmit / receive LoRa Packets over multiple frequencies (spread spectrum), we reduce the likelihood of packet collisions over the airwaves.

    We won't be using Spread Spectrum Transmission today, so `DIO2` shall stay idle.

-   __`DIO3` Channel Activity Detection__: The transceiver lets us __detect whether there's any ongoing transmission__ in a LoRa Radio Channel, in a power-efficient way.

    We won't be using Channel Activity Detection today.

-   __`DIO4`__ and __`DIO5`__ are not connected to BL602.  They are used for __FSK Radio Modulation__ only.

    (We're using LoRa Radio Modulation)

Only __1 pin `DIO0`__ is required for receiving simple LoRa Packets, without the frills (like Spread Spectrum Transmission).

But for now we shall connect __4 pins `DIO0` to `DIO3`__, just in case they will be needed later for LoRaWAN. (Which will probably use Spread Spectrum Transmission)

We shall configure BL602 to trigger __GPIO Interrupts__ when the 4 pins shift from Low to High.

# Initialise LoRa Transceiver

Let's look at the code inside our LoRa Firmware for BL602: `sdk_app_lora`

__Super Important:__ We should set the LoRa Frequency in [`demo.c`](https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/blob/lorarecv/customer_app/sdk_app_lora/sdk_app_lora/demo.c#L43-L58) like so...

```c
/// TODO: We are using LoRa Frequency 923 MHz 
/// for Singapore. Change this for your region.
#define USE_BAND_923
```

In a while we shall change `923` to the LoRa Frequency for our region: `434`, `780`, `868`, `915` or `923` MHz. [(Check this list)](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/lorawan/frequencies-by-country.html)

For now we'll study this function __`init_driver`__ that initialises the LoRa Driver for SX1276 (and RF96) in [`demo.c`](https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/blob/lorarecv/customer_app/sdk_app_lora/sdk_app_lora/demo.c#L126-L179)

```c
/// Command to initialise the SX1276 / RF96 driver
static void init_driver(char *buf, int len, int argc, char **argv) {
    //  Set the LoRa Callback Functions
    RadioEvents_t radio_events;
    memset(&radio_events, 0, sizeof(radio_events));  //  Must init radio_events to null, because radio_events lives on stack!
    radio_events.TxDone    = on_tx_done;
    radio_events.RxDone    = on_rx_done;
    radio_events.TxTimeout = on_tx_timeout;
    radio_events.RxTimeout = on_rx_timeout;
    radio_events.RxError   = on_rx_error;
```

`init_driver` begins by defining the __Callback Functions__ that will be called when we have transmitted or received a LoRa Packet (successfully or unsuccessfully)...

-   __Packet Transmitted: `on_tx_done`__

    Called when the transceiver has successfully transmitted a LoRa Packet.

-   __Packet Received: `on_rx_done`__

    Called when the tranceiver has received a LoRa Packet. (More about this in a while)

-   __Transmit Timeout: `on_tx_timeout`__

    Called if the transceiver is unable to transmit a LoRa Packet.

-   __Receive Timeout: `on_rx_timeout`__:

    Called if the transceiver doesn't receive any LoRa Packets within a timeout window. (More about this in a while)

-   __Receive Error: `on_rx_error`__:

    Called if the transceiver encounters an error when receiving a LoRa Packet. (More about this in a while)

Next we call __`Radio.Init` to initialise BL602's SPI Port and the LoRa Transceiver__...

```c
    //  Init the SPI Port and the LoRa Transceiver
    Radio.Init(&radio_events);
```

`Radio.Init` will set some registers on our LoRa Transceiver (over SPI).

Then we call __`Radio.SetChannel` to set the LoRa Frequency__...

```c
    //  Set the LoRa Frequency, which is specific to our region.
    //  For USE_BAND_923: RF_FREQUENCY is set to 923000000.
    Radio.SetChannel(RF_FREQUENCY);
```

`Radio.SetChannel` configures the LoRa Frequency by writing to the __Frequency Registers__ in our LoRa Transceiver.

We get ready to transmit by calling __`Radio.SetTxConfig`__...

```c
    //  Configure the LoRa Transceiver for transmitting messages
    Radio.SetTxConfig(
        MODEM_LORA,
        LORAPING_TX_OUTPUT_POWER,
        0,        //  Frequency deviation: Unused with LoRa
        LORAPING_BANDWIDTH,
        LORAPING_SPREADING_FACTOR,
        LORAPING_CODINGRATE,
        LORAPING_PREAMBLE_LENGTH,
        LORAPING_FIX_LENGTH_PAYLOAD_ON,
        true,     //  CRC enabled
        0,        //  Frequency hopping disabled
        0,        //  Hop period: N/A
        LORAPING_IQ_INVERSION_ON,
        LORAPING_TX_TIMEOUT_MS
    );
```

At the end of the function we call __`Radio.SetRxConfig`__ to configure the transceiver for receiving LoRa Packets...

```c
    //  Configure the LoRa Transceiver for receiving messages
    Radio.SetRxConfig(
        MODEM_LORA,
        LORAPING_BANDWIDTH,
        LORAPING_SPREADING_FACTOR,
        LORAPING_CODINGRATE,
        0,        //  AFC bandwidth: Unused with LoRa
        LORAPING_PREAMBLE_LENGTH,
        LORAPING_SYMBOL_TIMEOUT,
        LORAPING_FIX_LENGTH_PAYLOAD_ON,
        0,        //  Fixed payload length: N/A
        true,     //  CRC enabled
        0,        //  Frequency hopping disabled
        0,        //  Hop period: N/A
        LORAPING_IQ_INVERSION_ON,
        true      //  Continuous receive mode
    );    
}
```

_What's Continuous Receive Mode?_

__Continuous Receive Mode__ means that the transceiver will wait forever for incoming packets... Until we tell it to stop.

(We'll stop the transceiver with a BL602 Timer)

But before that, we need to tell the transceiver to begin receiving packets. That's coming up next...

(The code in this article is based on the [LoRa Ping](https://github.com/apache/mynewt-core/blob/master/apps/loraping/src/main.c) program from Mynewt OS. [More about this](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/lora#appendix-porting-lora-driver-from-mynewt-to-bl602))

# Receive LoRa Packet

We're creating a __battery-powered__ IoT Sensor with LoRa.

To conserve battery power, we don't listen for incoming LoRa Packets all the time... We __listen for 5 seconds__ then go to sleep.

This is how we do it: [`demo.c`](https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/blob/lorarecv/customer_app/sdk_app_lora/sdk_app_lora/demo.c#L207-L213)

```c
/// LoRa Receive Timeout in 5 seconds
#define LORAPING_RX_TIMEOUT_MS 5000  //  Milliseconds

/// Command to receive a LoRa message. Assume that SX1276 / RF96 driver has been initialised.
/// Assume that create_task has been called to init the Event Queue.
static void receive_message(char *buf, int len, int argc, char **argv) {
    //  Receive a LoRa message within 5 seconds
    Radio.Rx(LORAPING_RX_TIMEOUT_MS);
}
```

The __`receive_message`__ command calls __`Radio.Rx`__ (from the SX1276 Driver) to receive a LoRa Packet within 5 seconds.

## Receive Callback

Upon receiving the LoRa Packet, the SX1276 Driver calls the Callback Function __`on_rx_done`__ in [`demo.c`](https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/blob/lorarecv/customer_app/sdk_app_lora/sdk_app_lora/demo.c#L355-L381)

```c
/// Callback Function that is called when a LoRa message has been received
static void on_rx_done(
    uint8_t *payload,  //  Buffer containing received LoRa message
    uint16_t size,     //  Size of the LoRa message
    int16_t rssi,      //  Signal strength
    int8_t snr) {      //  Signal To Noise ratio

    //  Switch the LoRa Transceiver to low power, sleep mode
    Radio.Sleep();
```

At the start of `on_rx_done`, we __power down the LoRa Transceiver__ to conserve battery power.

Next we __copy the received packet__ into our 64-byte buffer __`loraping_buffer`__...

```c
    //  Copy the received packet (up to 64 bytes)
    if (size > sizeof loraping_buffer) {
        size = sizeof loraping_buffer;
    }
    loraping_rx_size = size;
    memcpy(loraping_buffer, payload, size);
```

At the end of the callback, we __display the contents__ of the copied packet...

```c
    //  Dump the contents of the received packet
    for (int i = 0; i < loraping_rx_size; i++) {
        printf("%02x ", loraping_buffer[i]);
    }
    printf("\r\n");

    //  Log the signal strength, signal to noise ratio
    loraping_rxinfo_rxed(rssi, snr);
}
```

_Is it really OK to call `printf` here?_

Yes because this code runs in the context of the __FreeRTOS Application Task__, not in the context of the Interrupt Handler. We'll learn why in a while.

(This differs from the original [LoRa Ping](https://github.com/apache/mynewt-core/blob/master/apps/loraping/src/main.c) program... On Mynewt OS, `on_rx_done` and other Callback Functions will run in the context of the Interrupt Handler)

## Timeout and Error Callbacks

_What happens when we don't receive a LoRa Packet in 5 seconds?_

The SX1276 Driver calls our Callback Function __`on_rx_timeout`__ that's defined in [`demo.c`](https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/blob/lorarecv/customer_app/sdk_app_lora/sdk_app_lora/demo.c#L398-L412)

```c
/// Callback Function that is called when no LoRa messages could be received due to timeout
static void on_rx_timeout(void) {
    //  Switch the LoRa Transceiver to low power, sleep mode
    Radio.Sleep();

    //  Log the timeout
    loraping_stats.rx_timeout++;
    loraping_rxinfo_timeout();
}
```

Here we power down the LoRa Transceiver to conserve battery life.

We do the same in the Callback Function __`on_rx_error`__, which the SX1276 Driver calls when it hits an error receiving LoRa Packets: [`demo.c`](https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/blob/lorarecv/customer_app/sdk_app_lora/sdk_app_lora/demo.c#L414-L427)

```c
/// Callback Function that is called when we couldn't receive a LoRa message due to error
static void on_rx_error(void) {
    //  Log the error
    loraping_stats.rx_error++;

    //  Switch the LoRa Transceiver to low power, sleep mode
    Radio.Sleep();
}
```

## Enter LoRa commands

Let's enter some commands to transmit a LoRa Packet!

1.  Press Enter to reveal the command prompt.

1.  Enter `help` to see the available commands...

    ```text
    # help
    ====User Commands====
    read_registers           : Read registers
    send_message             : Send LoRa message
    spi_result               : Show SPI counters
    ```

1.  First we __initialise our LoRa Transceiver__. 

    Enter this command...

    ```text
    # init_driver
    ```

    This command calls the function `init_driver`, which we have seen earlier.

1.  We should see this...

    ```text
    # init_driver
    port0 eventloop init = 42010760
    [HAL] [SPI] Init :
    port=0, mode=0, polar_phase = 1, freq=200000, tx_dma_ch=2, rx_dma_ch=3, pin_clk=3, pin_cs=2, pin_mosi=1, pin_miso=4
    set rwspeed = 200000
    hal_gpio_init: cs:2, clk:3, mosi:1, miso: 4
    hal_gpio_init: SPI controller mode
    hal_spi_init.
    ```

    The above messages say that our SPI Port has been configured by the BL602 SPI HAL.

    ```text
    hal_spi_transfer = 1
    transfer xfer[0].len = 1
    Tx DMA src=0x4200cc58, dest=0x4000a288, size=1, si=1, di=0, i=1
    Rx DMA src=0x4000a28c, dest=0x4200cc54, size=1, si=0, di=1, i=1
    recv all event group.
    ...
    ```

    `init_driver` has just configured our SPI Transceiver by setting the registers over SPI.

1.  Next we __transmit a LoRa Packet__...

    ```text
    # send_message
    ```

    This command calls the function `send_message`, which we have seen earlier.

1.  We should see this...

    ```text
    # send_message
    hal_spi_transfer = 1
    transfer xfer[0].len = 1
    Tx DMA src=0x4200cc58, dest=0x4000a288, size=1, si=1, di=0, i=1
    Rx DMA src=0x4000a28c, dest=0x4200cc54, size=1, si=0, di=1, i=1
    recv all event group.
    ...

    That's `send_message` blasting the 64-byte LoRa Packet to the airwave, in the simple "Fire And Forget" Mode.

    (The LoRa Driver copies the 64-byte Transmit Buffer to our LoRa Transceiver over SPI, byte by byte. Hence the numerous SPI requests.)

We have come a loooong way since I first [__experimented with LoRa in 2016__](https://github.com/lupyuen/LoRaArduino)...

- __Cheaper Transceivers__: Shipped overnight from Thailand!

- __Mature Networks__: LoRaWAN, The Things Network

- __Better Drivers__: Thanks to Apache Mynewt OS!

- __Powerful Microcontrollers__: Arduino Uno vs RISC-V BL602

- __Awesome Tools__: RAKwireless WisBlock, Airspy SDR, RF Explorer

Now is the __right time to build LoRa gadgets.__ Stay tuned for more LoRa Adventures!

Meanwhile there's plenty more code in the [__BL602 IoT SDK__](https://github.com/bouffalolab/bl_iot_sdk) to be deciphered and documented: __ADC, DAC, WiFi, Bluetooth LE,__ ...
