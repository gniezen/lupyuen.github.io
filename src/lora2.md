# PineCone BL602 RISC-V Board Receives LoRa Packets

üìù _2 Apr 2021_

Not too long ago (and not so far away) we embarked on an epic quest to create a low-power, long-range [__LoRa IoT Sensor__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoRa) with [__PineCone BL602 RISC-V Board__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/pinecone)

1.  We created a __LoRa Transmitter__ with BL602...

    [__"Connect PineCone BL602 to LoRa Transceiver"__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/lora)

1.  Then we tested it with a __LoRa Receiver__: RAKwireless WisBlock...

    [__"RAKwireless WisBlock talks LoRa with PineCone BL602 RISC-V Board"__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/wisblock)

Today we shall create the LoRa Firmware for BL602 that will __Receive LoRa Packets__. And test it with RAKwireless WisBlock as the LoRa Transmitter.

_Why do we need to receive LoRa Packets... If our BL602 LoRa Sensor will only transmit sensor data?_

Because we'll soon connect our BL602 LoRa Sensor to a __secure, managed LoRaWAN Network__ like [__The Things Network__](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/). (Or maybe [__Helium__](https://www.helium.com/lorawan))

Our BL602 gadget can't join these networks unless it can receive packets and respond to the network.

Let's make it so! (Because we do... Or do not... There is no try!)

The LoRa Firmware in this article will run on __PineCone, Pinenut and Any BL602 Board__.

Here's a closer look at the pins connected on BL602...

![PineCone BL602 RISC-V Board connected to Hope RF96 LoRa Transceiver](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/lora2-connect4.jpg)

_Why is BL602 Pin 2 unused?_

__`GPIO 2`__ is the __Unused SPI Chip Select__ on BL602.

We won't use this pin because we'll control Chip Select ourselves on `GPIO 14`. [(See this)](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/spi#control-our-own-chip-select-pin)

Here are the pins connected on our LoRa Transceiver: SX1276 or RF96...

(`ISO` and `OSI` appear flipped in this pic... Rotate your phone / computer screen 180 degrees for the proper perspective)

![PineCone BL602 RISC-V Board connected to Hope RF96 LoRa Transceiver](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/lora2-connect5.jpg)

_Why do we connect so many pins on SX1276 (or RF96)?_

The SX1276 and RF96 transceivers have __6 (!) Digital Input / Output pins: `DIO0` to `DIO5`__

The transceiver shifts the Logic Levels of these pins from __Low to High__ when specific conditions occur...

-   __`DIO0` Packet Received__: This pin is triggered when the transceiver __receives a LoRa Packet.__

    `DIO0` is also triggered after the transceiver has transmitted a LoRa Packet, but that's not so useful.

-   __`DIO1` Receive Timeout__: This pin is triggered when the transceiver __doesn't receive any LoRa Packets__ within a timeout window.

    This works only when the transceiver is configured for __Single Receive Mode__.

    However today we're configuring our transceiver for __Continuous Receive Mode__ so we won't be using `DIO1`. We shall trigger receive timeouts with a BL602 Timer.

-   __`DIO2` Change Channel__: This is used for __Spread Spectrum Transmission__ (Frequency Hopping). 

    When we transmit / receive LoRa Packets over multiple frequencies (spread spectrum), we reduce the likelihood of packet collisions over the airwaves.

    We won't be using Spread Spectrum Transmission today, so `DIO2` shall stay idle.

-   __`DIO3` Channel Activity Detection__: The transceiver lets us __detect whether there's any ongoing transmission__ in a LoRa Radio Channel, in a power-efficient way.

    We won't be using Channel Activity Detection today.

-   __`DIO4`__ and __`DIO5`__ are not connected to BL602.  They are used for __FSK Radio Modulation__ only.

    (We're using LoRa Radio Modulation)

Only __1 pin `DIO0`__ is required for receiving simple LoRa Packets, without the frills (like Spread Spectrum Transmission).

But for now we shall connect __4 pins `DIO0` to `DIO3`__, just in case they will be needed later for LoRaWAN. (Which will probably use Spread Spectrum Transmission)

We shall configure BL602 to trigger __GPIO Interrupts__ when the 4 pins shift from Low to High.

# Initialise LoRa Transceiver

Let's look at the code inside our LoRa Firmware for BL602: `sdk_app_lora`

__Super Important:__ We should set the LoRa Frequency in [`demo.c`](https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/blob/lorarecv/customer_app/sdk_app_lora/sdk_app_lora/demo.c#L43-L58) like so...

```c
/// TODO: We are using LoRa Frequency 923 MHz 
/// for Singapore. Change this for your region.
#define USE_BAND_923
```

In a while we shall change `923` to the LoRa Frequency for our region: `434`, `780`, `868`, `915` or `923` MHz. [(Check this list)](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/lorawan/frequencies-by-country.html)

For now we'll study this function __`init_driver`__ that initialises the LoRa Driver for SX1276 (and RF96) in [`demo.c`](https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/blob/lorarecv/customer_app/sdk_app_lora/sdk_app_lora/demo.c#L126-L179)

```c
/// Command to initialise the SX1276 / RF96 driver
static void init_driver(char *buf, int len, int argc, char **argv) {
    //  Set the LoRa Callback Functions
    RadioEvents_t radio_events;
    memset(&radio_events, 0, sizeof(radio_events));  //  Must init radio_events to null, because radio_events lives on stack!
    radio_events.TxDone    = on_tx_done;
    radio_events.RxDone    = on_rx_done;
    radio_events.TxTimeout = on_tx_timeout;
    radio_events.RxTimeout = on_rx_timeout;
    radio_events.RxError   = on_rx_error;
```

`init_driver` begins by defining the __Callback Functions__ that will be called when we have transmitted or received a LoRa Packet (successfully or unsuccessfully)...

-   __Packet Transmitted: `on_tx_done`__

    Called when the transceiver has successfully transmitted a LoRa Packet.

-   __Packet Received: `on_rx_done`__

    Called when the tranceiver has received a LoRa Packet. (More about this in a while)

-   __Transmit Timeout: `on_tx_timeout`__

    Called if the transceiver is unable to transmit a LoRa Packet.

-   __Receive Timeout: `on_rx_timeout`__:

    Called if the transceiver doesn't receive any LoRa Packets within a timeout window. (More about this in a while)

-   __Receive Error: `on_rx_error`__:

    Called if the transceiver encounters an error when receiving a LoRa Packet. (More about this in a while)

Next we call __`Radio.Init` to initialise BL602's SPI Port and the LoRa Transceiver__...

```c
    //  Init the SPI Port and the LoRa Transceiver
    Radio.Init(&radio_events);
```

`Radio.Init` will set some registers on our LoRa Transceiver (over SPI).

Then we call __`Radio.SetChannel` to set the LoRa Frequency__...

```c
    //  Set the LoRa Frequency, which is specific to our region.
    //  For USE_BAND_923: RF_FREQUENCY is set to 923000000.
    Radio.SetChannel(RF_FREQUENCY);
```

`Radio.SetChannel` configures the LoRa Frequency by writing to the __Frequency Registers__ in our LoRa Transceiver.

We get ready to transmit by calling __`Radio.SetTxConfig`__...

```c
    //  Configure the LoRa Transceiver for transmitting messages
    Radio.SetTxConfig(
        MODEM_LORA,
        LORAPING_TX_OUTPUT_POWER,
        0,        //  Frequency deviation: Unused with LoRa
        LORAPING_BANDWIDTH,
        LORAPING_SPREADING_FACTOR,
        LORAPING_CODINGRATE,
        LORAPING_PREAMBLE_LENGTH,
        LORAPING_FIX_LENGTH_PAYLOAD_ON,
        true,     //  CRC enabled
        0,        //  Frequency hopping disabled
        0,        //  Hop period: N/A
        LORAPING_IQ_INVERSION_ON,
        LORAPING_TX_TIMEOUT_MS
    );
```

At the end of the function we call __`Radio.SetRxConfig`__ to configure the transceiver for receiving LoRa Packets...

```c
    //  Configure the LoRa Transceiver for receiving messages
    Radio.SetRxConfig(
        MODEM_LORA,
        LORAPING_BANDWIDTH,
        LORAPING_SPREADING_FACTOR,
        LORAPING_CODINGRATE,
        0,        //  AFC bandwidth: Unused with LoRa
        LORAPING_PREAMBLE_LENGTH,
        LORAPING_SYMBOL_TIMEOUT,
        LORAPING_FIX_LENGTH_PAYLOAD_ON,
        0,        //  Fixed payload length: N/A
        true,     //  CRC enabled
        0,        //  Frequency hopping disabled
        0,        //  Hop period: N/A
        LORAPING_IQ_INVERSION_ON,
        true      //  Continuous receive mode
    );    
}
```

_What's Continuous Receive Mode?_

__Continuous Receive Mode__ means that the transceiver will wait forever for incoming packets... Until we tell it to stop.

(We'll stop the transceiver with a BL602 Timer)

But before that, we need to tell the transceiver to begin receiving packets. That's coming up next...

(The code in this article is based on the [LoRa Ping](https://github.com/apache/mynewt-core/blob/master/apps/loraping/src/main.c) program from Mynewt OS. [More about this](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/lora#appendix-porting-lora-driver-from-mynewt-to-bl602))

# Receive LoRa Packet

We're creating a __battery-powered__ IoT Sensor with LoRa.

To conserve battery power, we don't listen for incoming LoRa Packets all the time... We __listen for 5 seconds__ then go to sleep.

This is how we do it: [`demo.c`](https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/blob/lorarecv/customer_app/sdk_app_lora/sdk_app_lora/demo.c#L207-L213)

```c
/// LoRa Receive Timeout in 5 seconds
#define LORAPING_RX_TIMEOUT_MS 5000  //  Milliseconds

/// Command to receive a LoRa message. Assume that SX1276 / RF96 driver has been initialised.
/// Assume that create_task has been called to init the Event Queue.
static void receive_message(char *buf, int len, int argc, char **argv) {
    //  Receive a LoRa message within 5 seconds
    Radio.Rx(LORAPING_RX_TIMEOUT_MS);
}
```

The __`receive_message`__ command calls __`Radio.Rx`__ (from the SX1276 Driver) to receive a LoRa Packet within 5 seconds.

## Receive Callback

Upon receiving the LoRa Packet, the SX1276 Driver calls the Callback Function __`on_rx_done`__ in [`demo.c`](https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/blob/lorarecv/customer_app/sdk_app_lora/sdk_app_lora/demo.c#L355-L381)

```c
/// Callback Function that is called when a LoRa message has been received
static void on_rx_done(
    uint8_t *payload,  //  Buffer containing received LoRa message
    uint16_t size,     //  Size of the LoRa message
    int16_t rssi,      //  Signal strength
    int8_t snr) {      //  Signal To Noise ratio

    //  Switch the LoRa Transceiver to low power, sleep mode
    Radio.Sleep();
```

At the start of `on_rx_done`, we __power down the LoRa Transceiver__ to conserve battery power.

Next we __copy the received packet__ into our 64-byte buffer __`loraping_buffer`__...

```c
    //  Copy the received packet (up to 64 bytes)
    if (size > sizeof loraping_buffer) {
        size = sizeof loraping_buffer;
    }
    loraping_rx_size = size;
    memcpy(loraping_buffer, payload, size);
```

At the end of the callback, we __display the contents__ of the copied packet...

```c
    //  Dump the contents of the received packet
    for (int i = 0; i < loraping_rx_size; i++) {
        printf("%02x ", loraping_buffer[i]);
    }
    printf("\r\n");

    //  Log the signal strength, signal to noise ratio
    loraping_rxinfo_rxed(rssi, snr);
}
```

_Is it really OK to call `printf` here?_

Yes because this code runs in the context of the __FreeRTOS Application Task__, not in the context of the Interrupt Handler. We'll learn why in a while.

(This differs from the original [LoRa Ping](https://github.com/apache/mynewt-core/blob/master/apps/loraping/src/main.c) program... On Mynewt OS, `on_rx_done` and other Callback Functions will run in the context of the Interrupt Handler)

## Timeout and Error Callbacks

_What happens when we don't receive a LoRa Packet in 5 seconds?_

The SX1276 Driver calls our Callback Function __`on_rx_timeout`__ that's defined in [`demo.c`](https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/blob/lorarecv/customer_app/sdk_app_lora/sdk_app_lora/demo.c#L398-L412)

```c
/// Callback Function that is called when no LoRa messages could be received due to timeout
static void on_rx_timeout(void) {
    //  Switch the LoRa Transceiver to low power, sleep mode
    Radio.Sleep();

    //  Log the timeout
    loraping_stats.rx_timeout++;
    loraping_rxinfo_timeout();
}
```

Here we power down the LoRa Transceiver to conserve battery power.

We do the same in the Callback Function __`on_rx_error`__, which the SX1276 Driver calls when it hits an error receiving LoRa Packets: [`demo.c`](https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/blob/lorarecv/customer_app/sdk_app_lora/sdk_app_lora/demo.c#L414-L427)

```c
/// Callback Function that is called when we couldn't receive a LoRa message due to error
static void on_rx_error(void) {
    //  Log the error
    loraping_stats.rx_error++;

    //  Switch the LoRa Transceiver to low power, sleep mode
    Radio.Sleep();
}
```

# BL602 GPIO Interrupts

Let's talk about __handling GPIO Interrupts__ on BL602...

![BL602 handling GPIO interrupts](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/lora2-interrupt.png)

1.  When our LoRa Transceiver (SX1276) __receives a LoRa Packet__...

1.  It shifts the Logic Level of __Pin `DIO0` from Low to High__

1.  We shall configure BL602 to detect this shift in the connected GPIO Pin and trigger a __GPIO Interrupt__

1.  The __GPIO Interrupt Handler__ in our firmware code will then process the received LoRa Packet. (And reset `DIO0` back to Low)

Here's how we configure a GPIO Interrupt Handler on BL602: [`sx1276-board.c`](https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/blob/lorarecv/customer_app/sdk_app_lora/sdk_app_lora/sx1276-board.c#L144-L240)

```c
//  SX1276 DIO0 is connected to BL602 at GPIO 11
#define SX1276_DIO0 11

//  Register GPIO Handler for DIO0
int rc = register_gpio_handler(   //  Register GPIO Handler...
    SX1276_DIO0,                  //  GPIO Pin Number
    SX1276OnDio0Irq,              //  GPIO Handler Function
    GLB_GPIO_INT_CONTROL_ASYNC,   //  Async Control Mode
    GLB_GPIO_INT_TRIG_POS_PULSE,  //  Trigger when GPIO level shifts from Low to High
    0,                            //  No pullup
    0                             //  No pulldown
);
assert(rc == 0);
```

This call to __`register_gpio_handler`__ says...

1.  When BL602 detects __GPIO Pin 11__ (connected to `DIO0`) shifting from __Low to High__ (Positive Edge)...

1.  BL602 will call our GPIO Handler Function __`SX1276OnDio0Irq`__

We'll cover `register_gpio_handler` in the next section.

Then to enable GPIO Interrupts we call these functions from the __BL602 Interrupt Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)__...

```c
//  Register Common Interrupt Handler for GPIO Interrupt
bl_irq_register_with_ctx(
    GPIO_INT0_IRQn,         //  GPIO Interrupt
    handle_gpio_interrupt,  //  Interrupt Handler
    NULL                    //  Argument for Interrupt Handler
);

//  Enable GPIO Interrupt
bl_irq_enable(GPIO_INT0_IRQn);
```

__`handle_gpio_interrupt`__ is the low-level __Interrupt Handler__ that will be called by the BL602 GPIO HAL when the GPIO Interrupt is triggered.

We'll look inside `handle_gpio_interrupt` in a while.

## Register Handler Function

Let's look inside our function __`register_gpio_handler`__ and learn how it __registers a Handler Function for GPIO__: [`sx1276-board.c`](https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/blob/lorarecv/customer_app/sdk_app_lora/sdk_app_lora/sx1276-board.c#L341-L403)

```c
/// Register Handler Function for GPIO. Return 0 if successful.
/// GPIO Handler Function will run in the context of the Application Task, not the Interrupt Handler.
/// Based on bl_gpio_register in https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/blob/master/components/hal_drv/bl602_hal/bl_gpio.c
static int register_gpio_handler(
    uint8_t gpioPin,         //  GPIO Pin Number
    DioIrqHandler *handler,  //  GPIO Handler Function
    uint8_t intCtrlMod,      //  GPIO Interrupt Control Mode (see below)
    uint8_t intTrgMod,       //  GPIO Interrupt Trigger Mode (see below)
    uint8_t pullup,          //  1 for pullup, 0 for no pullup
    uint8_t pulldown) {      //  1 for pulldown, 0 for no pulldown
```

Above are the parameters for `register_gpio_handler`.

The __GPIO Interrupt Control Modes__ are...

-   __`GLB_GPIO_INT_CONTROL_SYNC`__:  Synchronous Mode

    (We never use sync mode)

-   __`GLB_GPIO_INT_CONTROL_ASYNC`__: Asynchronous Mode

    (We ALWAYS use async mode)

The BL602 Reference Manual doesn't mention GPIO Interrupt Control modes. But according to the BL602 HAL code, only __Async Mode__ should be used. [(See this)](https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/blob/master/components/hal_drv/bl602_hal/hal_button.c#L309)

The __GPIO Interrupt Trigger Mode__ specifies how the GPIO should trigger the interrupt...

-   __`GLB_GPIO_INT_TRIG_NEG_PULSE`__: Negative Edge Pulse Trigger

    Trigger the interrupt when the GPIO Logic Level shifts from __High to Low__

-   __`GLB_GPIO_INT_TRIG_POS_PULSE`__: Positive Edge Pulse Trigger

    Trigger the interrupt when the GPIO Logic Level shifts from __Low to High__

    (We use this for SX1276)

-   __`GLB_GPIO_INT_TRIG_NEG_LEVEL`__: Negative Edge Level Trigger (32k 3T)

    Trigger the interrupt when the GPIO Logic Level stays __Low__

-   __`GLB_GPIO_INT_TRIG_POS_LEVEL`__: Positive Edge Level Trigger (32k 3T)

    Trigger the interrupt when the GPIO Logic Level stays __High__

The GPIO Interrupt Trigger Mode is (partially) documented in the [BL602 Reference Manual](https://github.com/bouffalolab/bl_docs/tree/main/BL602_RM/en) (Section 3.2.12: "GPIO Interrupt"). [(This BL602 HAL code offers more hints)](https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/blob/master/components/hal_drv/bl602_hal/hal_button.c#L270-L312)

Our GPIO Handler Function `handler` shall be triggered through an Event (from the NimBLE Porting Layer). We'll learn why later...

```c
    //  Init the Event that will invoke the handler for the GPIO Interrupt
    int rc = init_interrupt_event(
        gpioPin,  //  GPIO Pin Number
        handler   //  GPIO Handler Function that will be triggered by the Event
    );
    assert(rc == 0);
```

Next we call `GLB_GPIO_Func_Init` to configure the pin as a __GPIO Pin__...

```c
    //  Configure pin as a GPIO Pin
    GLB_GPIO_Type pins[1];
    pins[0] = gpioPin;
    BL_Err_Type rc2 = GLB_GPIO_Func_Init(
        GPIO_FUN_SWGPIO,  //  Configure as GPIO 
        pins,             //  Pins to be configured
        sizeof(pins) / sizeof(pins[0])  //  Number of pins (1)
    );
    assert(rc2 == SUCCESS);    
```

`GLB_GPIO_Func_Init` comes from the BL602 Standard Driver: [`bl602_glb.c`](https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/blob/master/components/bl602/bl602_std/bl602_std/StdDriver/Src/bl602_glb.c)

We configure the pin as a __GPIO Input Pin__ (instead of GPIO Output)...

```c
    //  Configure pin as a GPIO Input Pin
    rc = bl_gpio_enable_input(
        gpioPin,  //  GPIO Pin Number
        pullup,   //  1 for pullup, 0 for no pullup
        pulldown  //  1 for pulldown, 0 for no pulldown
    );
    assert(rc == 0);
```

Finally we disable the GPIO Pin Interrupt, configure the __GPIO Interrupt Control and Trigger Modes__, and enable the GPIO Pin Interrupt...

```c
    //  Disable GPIO Interrupt for the pin
    bl_gpio_intmask(gpioPin, 1);

    //  Configure GPIO Pin for GPIO Interrupt
    bl_set_gpio_intmod(
        gpioPin,     //  GPIO Pin Number
        intCtrlMod,  //  GPIO Interrupt Control Mode (see below)
        intTrgMod    //  GPIO Interrupt Trigger Mode (see below)
    );

    //  Enable GPIO Interrupt for the pin
    bl_gpio_intmask(gpioPin, 0);
    return 0;
}
```

We're ready to handle GPIO Interrupts triggered by our LoRa Transceiver!

_There seems to be 2 types of GPIO Interrupts?_

Yep, earlier we saw this...

```c
//  Enable GPIO Interrupt
bl_irq_enable(GPIO_INT0_IRQn);
```

This enables the GPIO Interrupt for __ALL GPIO Pins__ (by calling the BL602 Interrupt HAL).

Then we saw this...

```c
//  Enable GPIO Interrupt for the pin
bl_gpio_intmask(gpioPin, 0);
```

This enables the GPIO Interrupt for __ONE Specific GPIO Pin__ (by calling the BL602 GPIO HAL).

We need both to make GPIO Interrupts work.

## GPIO Interrupt Handler

_GPIO Interrupt Handler vs GPIO Handler Function... Are these different things?_

I'm sorry to muddle my dearest readers, they are indeed different things and they work at different levels...

![GPIO Interrupt Handler vs GPIO Handler Function](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/lora2-handler.png)

1.  __GPIO Interrupt Handler__ (`handle_gpio_interrupt`) is the low-level __Interrupt Service Routine__ that handles the GPIO Interrupt.

    This Interrupt Handler (called by BL602 Interrupt HAL) services the GPIO Interrupt that's triggered when SX1276 receives a LoRa Packet.

1.  __GPIO Handler Function__ (like `SX1276OnDio0Irq`) is the high-level __Application Function__ (running in a FreeRTOS Task) that processes the received LoRa Packet.

    This Handler Function is invoked (indirectly) by the Interrupt Handler (via an Event from NimBLE Porting Layer).

    (What's an Event and why are we using it? We'll learn about the NimBLE Porting Layer in the next chapter)

Let's study the low-level __GPIO Interrupt Handler `handle_gpio_interrupt`__ that services all GPIO Interrupts: [`sx1276-board.c`](https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/blob/lorarecv/customer_app/sdk_app_lora/sdk_app_lora/sx1276-board.c#L405-L433)

```c
/// Maximum number of GPIO Pins that can be configured for interrupts
#define MAX_GPIO_INTERRUPTS 6  //  DIO0 to DIO5

/// Array of GPIO Pin Numbers that have been configured for interrupts
static uint8_t gpio_interrupts[MAX_GPIO_INTERRUPTS];

/// Array of Events for the GPIO Interrupts
static struct ble_npl_event gpio_events[MAX_GPIO_INTERRUPTS];

/// Interrupt Handler for GPIO Pins DIO0 to DIO5
static void handle_gpio_interrupt(void *arg) {

    //  Check all GPIO Interrupt Events
    for (int i = 0; i < MAX_GPIO_INTERRUPTS; i++) {

        //  Get the GPIO Pin Number for the Event
        GLB_GPIO_Type gpioPin = gpio_interrupts[i];

        //  Get the GPIO Interrupt Event
        struct ble_npl_event *ev = &gpio_events[i];
```

We start the GPIO Interrupt Handler `handle_gpio_interrupt` by __iterating through the GPIO Interrupts__ that we have configured (for `DIO0` to `DIO5`).

The configured GPIO Interrupts are stored in arrays __`gpio_interrupts` and `gpio_events`__ like so...

![GPIO Interrupts and Events](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/lora2-events.png)

For the first iteration...

-   Since `DIO0` is connected to __GPIO Pin 11__...

    __`gpioPin`__ shall be set to __`11`__

    (Via `gpio_interrupts[0]`)

-   Since `DIO0` is handled by the __GPIO Handler Function `SX1276OnDio0Irq`__...

    __`ev`__ shall be set to the Event that points to __`SX1276OnDio0Irq`__

    (Via `gpio_events[0]`)

    (More about `gpio_interrupts` and `gpio_events` in the next chapter)

We allow unused GPIO Pins, and we skip them like so...

```c
        //  If the Event is unused, skip it
        if (ev->fn == NULL) { continue; }
```

Next we fetch the __Interrupt Status__ of the GPIO Pin, to determine whether this GPIO Pin has triggered the interrupt...

```c
        //  Get the Interrupt Status of the GPIO Pin
        BL_Sts_Type status = GLB_Get_GPIO_IntStatus(gpioPin);
```

`GLB_Get_GPIO_IntStatus` comes from the BL602 Standard Driver: [`bl602_glb.c`](https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/blob/master/components/bl602/bl602_std/bl602_std/StdDriver/Src/bl602_glb.c)

If this GPIO Pin has indeed triggered the interrupt, we __enqueue the Event__ (containing our GPIO Handler Function) for the Application Task to handle...

```c
        //  If the GPIO Pin has triggered an interrupt...
        if (status == SET) {
            //  Forward the GPIO Interrupt to the Application Task to process
            enqueue_interrupt_event(
                gpioPin,  //  GPIO Pin Number
                ev        //  Event that will be enqueued for the Application Task
            );
        }
    }
}
```

In summary: Our GPIO Interrupt Handler...

1.  Iterates through all configured GPIO Interrupts (`DIO0` to `DIO5`)

1.  Hunts for the GPIO Interrupts that have been triggered

1.  Enqueues the GPIO Event (and Handler Function) for processing by the Application Task

Let's look at `enqueue_interrupt_event`...

## Enqueue Interrupt Event

The time has come to reveal the final piece of code that handles GPIO Interrupts: __`enqueue_interrupt_event`__ from [`sx1276-board.c`](https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/blob/lorarecv/customer_app/sdk_app_lora/sdk_app_lora/sx1276-board.c#L435-L469)

```c
/// Interrupt Counters
int g_dio0_counter, g_dio1_counter, g_dio2_counter, g_dio3_counter, g_dio4_counter, g_dio5_counter, g_nodio_counter;

/// Enqueue the GPIO Interrupt to an Event Queue for the Application Task to process
static int enqueue_interrupt_event(
    uint8_t gpioPin,                //  GPIO Pin Number
    struct ble_npl_event *event) {  //  Event that will be enqueued for the Application Task

    //  Disable GPIO Interrupt for the pin
    bl_gpio_intmask(gpioPin, 1);
```

We start by disabling the GPIO Interrupt for the pin.

Here's a helpful tip: Never clear the GPIO Interrupt Status by calling `bl_gpio_int_clear`...

```c
    //  Note: DO NOT Clear the GPIO Interrupt Status for the pin!
    //  This will suppress subsequent GPIO Interrupts!
    //  bl_gpio_int_clear(gpioPin, SET);
```

`bl_gpio_int_clear` causes __subsequent GPIO Interrupts to be suppressed__. So we should never call it!

We can't `printf` in an Interrupt Handler (for troubleshooting), but we can __increment some Interrupt Counters__ that will be displayed by the __`spi_result`__ command...

```c
    //  Increment the Interrupt Counters
    if (SX1276_DIO0 >= 0 && gpioPin == (uint8_t) SX1276_DIO0) { g_dio0_counter++; }
    //  Omitted: Increment Interrupt Counters
    //  for DIO1 to DIO4
    ...
    else if (SX1276_DIO5 >= 0 && gpioPin == (uint8_t) SX1276_DIO5) { g_dio5_counter++; }
    else { g_nodio_counter++; }
```

Next we add the Interrupt Event (with the Handler Function inside) to the __Event Queue__ (from the NimBLE Porting Layer)...

```c
    //  Use Event Queue to invoke Event Handler in the Application Task, 
    //  not in the Interrupt Context
    if (event != NULL && event->fn != NULL) {
        extern struct ble_npl_eventq event_queue;
        ble_npl_eventq_put(&event_queue, event);
    }
```

(In the next chapter we shall see the __Background Task__ that will receive the Event and process the received LoRa Packet)

We finish up by enabling the GPIO Interrupt for the pin...

```c
    //  Enable GPIO Interrupt for the pin
    bl_gpio_intmask(gpioPin, 0);
    return 0;
}
```

And that's how we handle GPIO Interrupts on BL602!

## Register Handlers for DIO0 to DIO5

_Earlier we registered the GPIO Handler Function for `DIO0`. What about `DIO1` to `DIO5`?_

Here's how we actually register the GPIO Handler Functions for `DIO0` to `DIO5`, in a single shot...

First we define the GPIO Pins for `DIO0` to `DIO5`: [`sx1276.h`](https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/blob/lorarecv/customer_app/sdk_app_lora/sdk_app_lora/sx1276.h#L48-L53)

```c
#define SX1276_DIO0        11  //  DIO0: Trigger for Packet Received
#define SX1276_DIO1         0  //  DIO1: Trigger for Sync Timeout
#define SX1276_DIO2         5  //  DIO2: Trigger for Change Channel (Spread Spectrum / Frequency Hopping)
#define SX1276_DIO3        12  //  DIO3: Trigger for CAD Done
#define SX1276_DIO4        -1  //  DIO4: Unused (FSK only)
#define SX1276_DIO5        -1  //  DIO5: Unused (FSK only)
```

Next we define the GPIO Handler Functions for `DIO0` to `DIO5`: [`sx1276.c`](https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/blob/lorarecv/customer_app/sdk_app_lora/sdk_app_lora/sx1276.c#L208-L213)

```c
//  DIO Handler Functions
DioIrqHandler *DioIrq[] = { 
    SX1276OnDio0Irq, SX1276OnDio1Irq,
    SX1276OnDio2Irq, SX1276OnDio3Irq,
    SX1276OnDio4Irq, NULL };  //  DIO5 not used for LoRa Modulation
```

Then we pass the DIO Handler Functions `DioIrq` to the function `SX1276IoIrqInit` defined in [`sx1276-board.c`](https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/blob/lorarecv/customer_app/sdk_app_lora/sdk_app_lora/sx1276-board.c#L144-L240)

```c
/// Register GPIO Interrupt Handlers for DIO0 to DIO5.
/// Based on hal_button_register_handler_with_dts in https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/blob/master/components/hal_drv/bl602_hal/hal_button.c
void SX1276IoIrqInit(DioIrqHandler **irqHandlers) {

    //  DIO0: Trigger for Packet Received and Packet Transmitted
    if (SX1276_DIO0 >= 0 && irqHandlers[0] != NULL) {
        int rc = register_gpio_handler(       //  Register GPIO Handler...
            SX1276_DIO0,                  //  GPIO Pin Number
            irqHandlers[0],               //  GPIO Handler Function
            GLB_GPIO_INT_CONTROL_ASYNC,   //  Async Control Mode
            GLB_GPIO_INT_TRIG_POS_PULSE,  //  Trigger when GPIO level shifts from Low to High
            0,                            //  No pullup
            0                             //  No pulldown
        );
        assert(rc == 0);
    }
```

This is similar to the code we've seen earlier for registering the GPIO Handler Function for `DIO0`.

The code for `DIO1` to `DIO5` looks highly similar...

```c
    //  Omitted: Register GPIO Handler Functions
    //  for DIO1 to DIO4
    ...

    //  DIO5: Unused (FSK only)
    if (SX1276_DIO5 >= 0 && irqHandlers[5] != NULL) {
        int rc = register_gpio_handler(       //  Register GPIO Handler...
            SX1276_DIO5,                  //  GPIO Pin Number
            irqHandlers[5],               //  GPIO Handler Function
            GLB_GPIO_INT_CONTROL_ASYNC,   //  Async Control Mode
            GLB_GPIO_INT_TRIG_POS_PULSE,  //  Trigger when GPIO level shifts from Low to High
            0,                            //  No pullup
            0                             //  No pulldown
        );
        assert(rc == 0);
    }
```

To wrap up, we register the GPIO Interrupt Handler and enable GPIO Interrupts (as explained earlier)...

```c
    //  Register Common Interrupt Handler for GPIO Interrupt
    bl_irq_register_with_ctx(
        GPIO_INT0_IRQn,         //  GPIO Interrupt
        handle_gpio_interrupt,  //  Interrupt Handler
        NULL                    //  Argument for Interrupt Handler
    );

    //  Enable GPIO Interrupt
    bl_irq_enable(GPIO_INT0_IRQn);
}
```

That is all... We register the GPIO Handler Functions for `DIO0` to `DIO5` with a single call to `SX1276IoIrqInit`.

[(Our SX1276 Driver calls `SX1276IoIrqInit` here)](https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/blob/lorarecv/customer_app/sdk_app_lora/sdk_app_lora/sx1276.c#L421-L458)

# Multitask with NimBLE Porting Layer

_Move Fast OR Break Things... Choose ONE!_

__Handling an interrupt__ gets tricky for any Embedded Program...

1.  __Interrupts are Time-Sensitive__: We can't take too long to handle an interrupt... Other interrupts may be waiting on us! 

    (Lag ensues)

1.  __No Blocking Input / Output__: Suppose our SX1276 Interrupt Handler needs to send an SPI Command to reset `DIO0`.

    That's no-no because our Interrupt Handler would block waiting for the SPI operation to complete. And hold up other interrupts.

1.  __No Console Output__: Troubleshooting an Interrupt Handler gets challenging because we can't show anything on the console (due to (1) and (2) above).

    (Also challenging: Handling errors in an Interrupt Handler)

Hence some chunks of our Interrupt Handling Logic would need to run inside a __higher-level, lower-priority Application Task__. Like this...

![Interrupt Handler vs Application Task](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/lora2-handler2.png)

Our Interrupt Handler (left) would need to signal the Application Task (right) to do some work.

_We'll do this with FreeRTOS, no?_

Let's do this with [__NimBLE Porting Layer__](https://lupyuen.github.io/pinetime-rust-mynewt/articles/dfu#nimble-stack-for-bluetooth-le-on-pinetime) instead.  It's a library of multitasking functions that's __portable to multiple operating systems__: FreeRTOS, Mynewt, NuttX, RIOT.

(And it looks simpler for folks who are new to FreeRTOS)

## Enter LoRa commands

Let's enter some commands to transmit a LoRa Packet!

1.  Press Enter to reveal the command prompt.

1.  Enter `help` to see the available commands...

    ```text
    # help
    ====User Commands====
    read_registers           : Read registers
    send_message             : Send LoRa message
    spi_result               : Show SPI counters
    ```

1.  First we __initialise our LoRa Transceiver__. 

    Enter this command...

    ```text
    # init_driver
    ```

    This command calls the function `init_driver`, which we have seen earlier.

1.  We should see this...

    ```text
    # init_driver
    port0 eventloop init = 42010760
    [HAL] [SPI] Init :
    port=0, mode=0, polar_phase = 1, freq=200000, tx_dma_ch=2, rx_dma_ch=3, pin_clk=3, pin_cs=2, pin_mosi=1, pin_miso=4
    set rwspeed = 200000
    hal_gpio_init: cs:2, clk:3, mosi:1, miso: 4
    hal_gpio_init: SPI controller mode
    hal_spi_init.
    ```

    The above messages say that our SPI Port has been configured by the BL602 SPI HAL.

    ```text
    hal_spi_transfer = 1
    transfer xfer[0].len = 1
    Tx DMA src=0x4200cc58, dest=0x4000a288, size=1, si=1, di=0, i=1
    Rx DMA src=0x4000a28c, dest=0x4200cc54, size=1, si=0, di=1, i=1
    recv all event group.
    ...
    ```

    `init_driver` has just configured our SPI Transceiver by setting the registers over SPI.

1.  Next we __transmit a LoRa Packet__...

    ```text
    # send_message
    ```

    This command calls the function `send_message`, which we have seen earlier.

1.  We should see this...

    ```text
    # send_message
    hal_spi_transfer = 1
    transfer xfer[0].len = 1
    Tx DMA src=0x4200cc58, dest=0x4000a288, size=1, si=1, di=0, i=1
    Rx DMA src=0x4000a28c, dest=0x4200cc54, size=1, si=0, di=1, i=1
    recv all event group.
    ...
    ```

    That's `send_message` blasting the 64-byte LoRa Packet to the airwave, in the simple "Fire And Forget" Mode.

    (The LoRa Driver copies the 64-byte Transmit Buffer to our LoRa Transceiver over SPI, byte by byte. Hence the numerous SPI requests.)
