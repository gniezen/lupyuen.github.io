_What is The Things Network?_

[__The Things Network__](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/) is a __crowd-sourced wireless network__. And it works __worldwide__!

Our __IoT Devices__ may connect to The Things Network and __transmit Sensor Data__ to the Cloud.

_How much does it cost?_

Nothing! The public community network is __Free for Fair Use__.

(The network has been free since its launch in 2015)

_Totally free! What's the catch?_

Here's what we need...

1.  __LoRa Wireless Module__: We'll use the __Semtech SX1232 LoRa Transceiver__ (Transmitter + Receiver) that's bundled with our PineDio Stack Board.

    (More about this in a while)

1.  __Network Coverage__: Check whether our area is covered by the network...

    [__The Things Network Global Coverage__](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/map)

1.  __Fair Use__: Because it's a free network for Sensor Data, we can't spam it with messages.

    Each device may transmit roughly __10 tiny messages per hour__.
    
    (Assuming 12 bytes per message)

    This varies by region, message size and data rate.
    
    (More about this in a while)

_Darn no coverage here. What now?_

Everyone is welcome to join The Things Network and __grow the network__!

In a while I'll explain how I __added my LoRaWAN Gateway__ to The Things Network.

[(I bought my RAKwireless RAK7248 Gateway for $280)](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisGate/RAK7248/Overview/)

_What is PineDio Stack?_

__PineDio Stack__ is a 32-bit RISC-V Microcontroller board...

Which has an onboard LoRa SX1262 Transceiver...

Today we'll walk through the steps for connecting PineDio Stack to The Things Network...
