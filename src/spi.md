# PineCone BL602 talks SPI too!

üìù _10 Feb 2021_

Here's the source code for BL602 accessing BME280 over SPI: [`sdk_app_spi/demo.c`](https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/blob/spi/customer_app/sdk_app_spi/sdk_app_spi/demo.c)

In this article we'll study the source code and look into these issues with BL602 SPI...

1.  The pins for __Serial Data In__ and __Serial Data Out__ seem to be flipped, when observed with a Logic Analyser. 

    This contradicts the BL602 Reference Manual.

1.  To talk to BME280, we must configure BL602 for __SPI Polarity 0, Phase 1__.

    Though the Logic Analyser shows that it looks like SPI Phase 0.

1.  BL602's __SPI Chip Select Pin__ doesn't work with BME280's SPI protocol.

    We'll control the SPI Chip Select Pin ourselves.

1.  Setting __Serial Data Out to Pin 0__ will switch on the WiFi LED.

    We'll switch to a different pin for Serial Data Out.

Also we'll learn to __troubleshoot BL602 SPI with a Logic Analyser__.

# Times Are a-Changin'

Humans evolve... So do the terms that we use!

This article will become obsolete quickly unless we adopt the [__new names for SPI Pins__](https://www.oshwa.org/a-resolution-to-redefine-spi-signal-names)...

-  We'll say __"Serial Data In"__ _(instead of "MISO")_

-  And we'll say __"Serial Data Out"__ _(instead of "MOSI")_

-  We'll refer to BL602 as the __"SPI Controller"__

-  And BME280 as the __"SPI Peripheral"__

Note that Serial Data In and Serial Data Out are flipped across the SPI Controller and the SPI Peripheral...

-  __Serial Data In on BL602__ connects to __Serial Data Out on BME280__

-  And __Serial Data Out on BL602__ connects to __Serial Data In on BME280__

(Yep it works like the Transmit / Receive pins for a UART port)
