Something interesting happens when we __flash firmware to BL602 and BL604__ RISC-V boards (above: PineDio Stack BL604, below: PineCone BL602)...

It starts a tiny program __inside the board__ to make flashing possible: The __EFlash Loader__.

Step by step we shall __uncover what's inside__ EFlash Loader, thanks to [__Ghidra__](https://ghidra-sre.org/) the popular tool for Software Reverse Engineering.

_Why are we doing this?_

1.  EFlash Loader is a critical part of the __Flashing Process__

    (Good to understand how it works)

1.  __No Source Code__ is available for EFlash Loader

    [(According to GitHub Code Search)](https://github.com/search?q=bflb_eflash_loader_cmd_write_flash&type=code)

1.  EFlash Loader is a __small__ (37 KB) and __self-contained__ program

    [(32-bit RISC-V, specifically RV32IMACF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V#ISA_base_and_extensions)

1.  EFlash Loader gets __updated occasionally__, so it's good for us to understand what's changed

This is my first time using Ghidra so this might be a fun and educational exercise!

(But please bear with my ignorance üôè)
