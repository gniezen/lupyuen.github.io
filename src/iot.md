In our last article we learnt to run barebones __Zig on a Microcontroller__ (RISC-V BL602) with a __Real-Time Operating System__ (Apache NuttX RTOS)...

-   [__"Zig on RISC-V BL602: Quick Peek with Apache NuttX RTOS"__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/zig)

_But can we do something way more sophisticated with Zig?_

Yes we can! Today we shall run a complex __IoT Application__ with __Zig and LoRaWAN__...

-   Join a [__LoRaWAN Wireless Network__](https://makezine.com/2021/05/24/go-long-with-lora-radio/)

-   Transmit a __Data Packet__ to the LoRaWAN Network at regular intervals

Which is the typical firmware we would run on __IoT Sensors__.

_Will this run on any device?_

We'll do this on Pine64's [__PineDio Stack BL604__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/pinedio2) RISC-V Board.

But the steps should be similar for BL602, ESP32-C3, Arm Cortex-M and other 32-bit microcontrollers supported by Zig.

_Why are we doing this?_

I always dreaded maintaining and extending complex __IoT Apps in C__. [(Like this one)](https://github.com/lupyuen/lorawan_test/blob/main/lorawan_test_main.c)

Will Zig make this a little less painful? Let's find out!
