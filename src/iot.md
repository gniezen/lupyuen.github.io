In our last article we learnt to run barebones __Zig on a Microcontroller__ (RISC-V BL602) with a __Real-Time Operating System__ (Apache NuttX RTOS)...

-   [__"Zig on RISC-V BL602: Quick Peek with Apache NuttX RTOS"__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/zig)

Today we shall run something way more sophisticated... A __Complex IoT Application__ with __Zig and LoRaWAN!__

We'll do this on Pine64's [__PineDio Stack BL604 RISC-V Board__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/pinedio2).

(The steps should be similar for BL602, ESP32-C3, Arm Cortex-M and other 32-bit microcontrollers supported by Zig)
