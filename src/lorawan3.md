_PineDio Stack BL604 RISC-V Board (left) talking LoRaWAN to RAKwireless WisGate LoRaWAN Gateway (right)_

Last article we got __LoRa__ (the long-range, low-bandwidth wireless network) running on [__Apache NuttX OS__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/nuttx)...

-   [__"LoRa SX1262 on Apache NuttX OS"__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/sx1262)

Today we shall run __LoRaWAN__ on NuttX OS!

_Why would we need LoRaWAN?_

LoRa will work perfectly fine for unsecured __Point-to-Point Wireless Communication__.

But if we need to __relay data packets__ securely to a Local Area Network or to the internet, we need __LoRaWAN__.

[(More about LoRaWAN)](https://makezine.com/2021/05/24/go-long-with-lora-radio/)

We shall test LoRaWAN on NuttX with Bouffalo Lab's [__BL602 and BL604 RISC-V SoCs__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/pinecone).

(It will probably run on __ESP32__, since we're calling standard NuttX Interfaces)

# Small Steps

In the last article we created a __LoRa Library for NuttX__ (top right) that works with __Semtech SX1262 Transceiver__...

-   [__lupyuen/lora-sx1262 (lorawan branch)__](https://github.com/lupyuen/lora-sx1262/tree/lorawan)

Today we'll create a __LoRaWAN Library for NuttX__ (centre right)...

-   [__lupyuen/LoRaMac-node-nuttx__](https://github.com/lupyuen/LoRaMac-node-nuttx)

That's a near-identical fork of __Semtech's LoRaWAN Stack__ (dated 14 Dec 2021)...

-   [__Lora-net/LoRaMac-node__](https://github.com/Lora-net/LoRaMac-node)

We'll test with this __LoRaWAN App__ on NuttX...

-   [__lupyuen/lorawan_test__](https://github.com/lupyuen/lorawan_test)

## LoRaWAN Support

_Why did we fork Semtech's LoRaWAN Stack? Why not build it specifically for NuttX?_

LoRaWAN works __slightly differently across the world regions__, to comply with Local Wireless Regulations: Radio Frequency, Maximum Airtime (Duty Cycle), [Listen Before Talk](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/lorawan#appendix-lora-carrier-sensing), ...

Thus we should port __Semtech's LoRaWAN Stack__ to NuttX with __minimal changes__, in case of future updates. (Like for new regions)

_How did we create the LoRaWAN Library?_

We followed the steps below to create __"nuttx/libs/liblorawan"__ by cloning a NuttX Library...

-   [__"Create a NuttX Library"__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/sx1262#appendix-create-a-nuttx-library)

Then we replaced the "liblorawan" folder by a __Git Submodule__ that contains our LoRaWAN code... 

```bash
cd nuttx/nuttx/libs
rm -r liblorawan
git rm -r liblorawan
git submodule add https://github.com/lupyuen/LoRaMac-node-nuttx liblorawan
```

[(To add the LoRaWAN Library to your NuttX Project, see this)](https://github.com/lupyuen/LoRaMac-node-nuttx)

## Dependencies

Our LoRaWAN Library should work on __any NuttX platform__ (like ESP32), assuming that the following dependencies are installed...

    SPI Test Driver
    
    [(See this)](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/spi2)

Our LoRa SX1262 Library assumes that the following __NuttX Devices__ are configured...

-   __/dev/gpio0__: GPIO Input for SX1262 Busy Pin

-   __/dev/gpio1__: GPIO Output for SX1262 Chip Select

-   __/dev/gpio2__: GPIO Interrupt for SX1262 DIO1 Pin

-   __/dev/spi0__: SPI Bus for SX1262

-   __/dev/spitest0__: SPI Test Driver (see above)

# LoRaWAN Objective

_What shall we accomplish with LoRaWAN today?_

We'll do the basic LoRaWAN use case on NuttX...

-   Join NuttX to the __LoRaWAN Network__

-   Send a __Data Packet__ from NuttX to LoRaWAN

Which works like this...

![LoRaWAN Use Case](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/lorawan3-flow.jpg)

1.  NuttX sends a __Join Network Request__ to the LoRaWAN Gateway.

    Inside the Join Network Request are...

    __Device EUI:__ Unique ID that's assigned to our LoRaWAN Device

    __Join EUI:__ Identifies the LoRaWAN Network that we're joining

    __Nonce:__ Non-repeating number, to prevent [Replay Attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replay_attack)

    (EUI means Extended Unique Identifier)

1.  LoRaWAN Gateway returns a __Join Network Response__

1.  NuttX sends a __Data Packet__ to the LoRaWAN Network

1.  NuttX uses an __App Key__ to sign the Join Network Request and the Data Packet

    (App Key is stored inside NuttX, never exposed over the airwaves)

Let's set the Device EUI, Join EUI and App Key.

# Notes

1.  This article is the expanded version of [this Twitter Thread](https://twitter.com/MisterTechBlog/status/1473593455699841027)

1.  We're __porting plenty of code__ to NuttX: LoRa, LoRaWAN and NimBLE Porting Layer. Do we expect any problems?

    -   If we implement LoRa and LoRaWAN as __NuttX Drivers__, we'll have to scrub the code to comply with the [__NuttX Coding Conventions__](https://nuttx.apache.org/docs/latest/contributing/coding_style.html).

        This makes it __harder to update__ the LoRaWAN Driver when there are changes in the LoRaWAN Spec. (Like for a new LoRaWAN Region)

        [(Here's an example)](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/lorawan#appendix-lora-carrier-sensing)

    -   Alternatively we may implement LoRa and LoRaWAN as __External Libraries__, similar to [__NimBLE for NuttX__](https://github.com/lupyuen/incubator-nuttx-apps/tree/master/wireless/bluetooth/nimble).

        (The [__Makefile__](https://github.com/lupyuen/incubator-nuttx-apps/blob/master/wireless/bluetooth/nimble/Makefile#L33) downloads the External Library during build)

        But then we won't get a proper NuttX Driver that exposes the ioctl() interface to NuttX Apps.

    Conundrum. Lemme know your thoughts!

1.  How do other Embedded Operating Systems implement LoRaWAN?

    -   __Mynewt__ embeds a [__Partial Copy__](https://github.com/apache/mynewt-core/tree/master/net/lora/node) of Semtech's LoRaWAN Stack into its source tree.

    -   __Zephyr__ maintains a [__Complete Fork__](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/loramac-node) of the entire LoRaWAN Repo by Semtech. Which gets embedded during the Zephyr build.

    The Zephyr approach is probably the best way to __keep our LoRaWAN Stack in sync__ with Semtech's.

1.  We have already ported LoRaWAN to __BL602 IoT SDK__ [(see this)](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/lorawan), why are we porting again to NuttX?

    Regrettably BL602 IoT SDK has been revamped (without warning) to the __new "hosal" HAL__ [(see this)](https://twitter.com/MisterTechBlog/status/1456259223323508748), and the LoRaWAN Stack will __no longer work__ on the revamped BL602 IoT SDK.

    For easier maintenance, we shall __code our BL602 and BL604 projects with Apache NuttX OS__ instead.

    (Which won't get revamped overnight!)

1.  Will NuttX become the official OS for PineDio Stack BL604 when it goes on sale?

    It might! But first let's get LoRaWAN (and ST7789) running on PineDio Stack.
