# Rust on RISC-V BL602: Is It Sunny?

üìù _8 Aug 2021_

Today we shall magically transform [__any RISC-V BL602 Board__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/pinecone) into a __Light Sensor!__

We'll code this firmware in C, then __port it to Rust.__

(By calling the [__Rust Wrapper for BL602 IoT SDK__](https://crates.io/crates/bl602-sdk))

_Wait... Do all BL602 Boards have an onboard Light Sensor?_

Nope, all we need is a __BL602 Board with an LED__!

Reading the LED with BL602's __Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)__ will turn it into a simple, improvised Light Sensor.

_Amazing! Will this work with any BL602 Board?_

I tested this with [__PineCone BL602__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/pinecone) and its onboard LED.

It will probably work with any BL602 / BL604 Board with an __onboard or external LED:__ PineDio Stack, Pinenut, DT-BL10, MagicHome BL602, ...

_Will our Light Sensor detect any kind of light?_

Our LED-turned-Light-Sensor works best for __detecting sunlight__... We'll learn why in a while.

(Yep It's Always Sunny in Singapore ... So this Sunlight Sensor won't be so useful in Singapore üòÇ)

# BL602 ADC in C

On PineCone BL602, there is a __Blue LED__ connected on __GPIO Pin Number 11__...

[(From PineCone RGB LED Schematic)](https://github.com/pine64/bl602-docs/blob/main/mirrored/Pine64%20BL602%20EVB%20Schematic%20ver%201.1.pdf)

We shall __read the voltage__ from this LED GPIO with BL602's Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC).

(Because LEDs will produce a current when exposed to light. [See this](https://wiki.analog.com/university/courses/electronics/electronics-lab-led-sensor?rev=1551786227))
