# Rust on RISC-V BL602: Is It Sunny?

üìù _8 Aug 2021_

Today we shall magically transform [__any RISC-V BL602 Board__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/pinecone) into a __Light Sensor!__

We'll code this firmware in C, then port it to Rust with the [__Rust Wrapper for BL602 IoT SDK__](https://crates.io/crates/bl602-sdk).

(New to Rust? No worries we have tips for you!)

_Wait... Do all BL602 Boards have an onboard Light Sensor?_

Nope, all we need is a __BL602 Board with an LED__!

Reading the LED with BL602's __Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)__ will turn it into a simple, improvised Light Sensor.

_Amazing! Will this work with any BL602 Board?_

I tested this with [__PineCone BL602__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/pinecone) and its onboard LED.

It will probably work with any BL602 / BL604 Board with an __onboard or external LED:__ PineDio Stack, Pinenut, DT-BL10, MagicHome BL602, ...

_Will our Light Sensor detect any kind of light?_

Our LED-turned-Light-Sensor works best for __detecting sunlight__... We'll learn why in a while.

(Yep It's Always Sunny in Singapore ... So this Sunlight Sensor won't be so useful in Singapore üòÇ)

# BL602 ADC in C

On PineCone BL602, there's a __Blue LED__ connected on __GPIO Pin Number 11__...

![PineCone RGB LED Schematic](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/led-rgb.png)

[(From PineCone RGB LED Schematic)](https://github.com/pine64/bl602-docs/blob/main/mirrored/Pine64%20BL602%20EVB%20Schematic%20ver%201.1.pdf)

For light sensing, we shall __read the voltage__ from this LED GPIO with BL602's Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC).

(Because LEDs will produce a current when exposed to light. [See this](https://wiki.analog.com/university/courses/electronics/electronics-lab-led-sensor?rev=1551786227))

Let's study the __C Firmware for BL602 ADC__: [`sdk_app_adc2`](https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/blob/adc/customer_app/sdk_app_adc2/)

By calling the [__BL602 ADC Low Level HAL__](https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/blob/master/components/hal_drv/bl602_hal/bl_adc.c) (Hardware Abstraction Layer), we shall...

1.  __Initialise the ADC Channel__ for reading our LED GPIO

1.  __Compute the average value__ of the ADC Samples that have been read

## Definitions

We start by defining the __GPIO Pin Number__ that will be read via ADC: [`demo.c`](https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/blob/adc/customer_app/sdk_app_adc2/sdk_app_adc2/demo.c#L13-L31)

```c
/// GPIO Pin Number that will be configured as ADC Input.
/// PineCone Blue LED is connected on BL602 GPIO 11.
/// PineCone Green LED is connected on BL602 GPIO 14.
/// Only these GPIOs are supported: 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15
/// TODO: Change the GPIO Pin Number for your BL602 board
#define ADC_GPIO 11
```

__Not all GPIOs__ are supported by BL602's ADC!

According to the BL602 Reference Manual, only the following GPIOs are __supported for ADC__: 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15

![ADC GPIO Pin Numbers](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/adc-pins.png)

Next we define the __ADC Frequency__. We shall read 10,000 ADC Samples every second...

```c
/// We set the ADC Frequency to 10 kHz according to <https://wiki.analog.com/university/courses/electronics/electronics-lab-led-sensor?rev=1551786227>
/// This is 10,000 samples per second.
#define ADC_FREQUENCY 10000  //  Hz
```

For computing the average, we shall remember the __last 1,000 ADC Samples read__...

```c
/// We shall read 1,000 ADC samples, which will take 0.1 seconds
#define ADC_SAMPLES 1000
```

Finally we set the __ADC Gain__ to increase the sensitivity of the ADC...

```c
/// Set ADC Gain to Level 1 to increase the ADC sensitivity.
/// To disable ADC Gain, set `ADC_GAIN1` and `ADC_GAIN2` to `ADC_PGA_GAIN_NONE`.
/// See <https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/blob/master/components/bl602/bl602_std/bl602_std/StdDriver/Inc/bl602_adc.h#L133-L144>
#define ADC_GAIN1 ADC_PGA_GAIN_1
#define ADC_GAIN2 ADC_PGA_GAIN_1
```

More about ADC Gain in a while.

## Initialise the ADC Channel

Here's how we __initialise the ADC Channel__ for reading our LED GPIO: [`demo.c`](https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/blob/adc/customer_app/sdk_app_adc2/sdk_app_adc2/demo.c#L36-L77)

```c
/// Command to init the ADC Channel and start reading the ADC Samples.
/// Based on `hal_adc_init` in <https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/blob/master/components/hal_drv/bl602_hal/hal_adc.c#L50-L102>
void init_adc(char *buf, int len, int argc, char **argv) {
  //  Only these GPIOs are supported: 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15
  assert(ADC_GPIO==4 || ADC_GPIO==5 || ADC_GPIO==6 || ADC_GPIO==9 || ADC_GPIO==10 || ADC_GPIO==11 || ADC_GPIO==12 || ADC_GPIO==13 || ADC_GPIO==14 || ADC_GPIO==15);

  //  For Single-Channel Conversion Mode, frequency must be between 500 and 16,000 Hz
  assert(ADC_FREQUENCY >= 500 && ADC_FREQUENCY <= 16000);

  //  Init the ADC Frequency for Single-Channel Conversion Mode
  int rc = bl_adc_freq_init(1, ADC_FREQUENCY);
  assert(rc == 0);
```

Our __`init_adc` Command__ begins by validating the GPIO Pin Number and ADC Frequency.

Then it calls __`bl_adc_freq_init`__ to set the __ADC Frequency__.

(Functions named `bl_adc_*` are defined in the [BL602 ADC Low Level HAL](https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/blob/master/components/hal_drv/bl602_hal/bl_adc.c))

The first parameter to `bl_adc_freq_init` selects the __ADC Mode__...

-   ADC Mode 0: __Scan Conversion Mode__

    BL602 ADC Controller reads __One ADC Sample__ from __Multiple ADC Channels.__

    (So it's scanning across multiple ADC Channels, recording one sample per channel)

-   ADC Mode 1: __Single-Channel Conversion Mode__

    BL602 ADC Controller reads __Multiple ADC Samples__ continuously from __One ADC Channel.__

    (This is the mode we're using)

Next we set the __ADC GPIO Pin Number__ for ADC Mode 1 (Single-Channel Conversion)...

```c
  //  Init the ADC GPIO for Single-Channel Conversion Mode
  rc = bl_adc_init(1, ADC_GPIO);
  assert(rc == 0);
```

To increase the ADC sensitivity, we set the __ADC Gain__...

```c
  //  Enable ADC Gain to increase the ADC sensitivity
  rc = set_adc_gain(ADC_GAIN1, ADC_GAIN2);
  assert(rc == 0);
```

(More about this in a while)

BL602 ADC Controller shall transfer the ADC Samples directly into RAM, thanks to the __Direct Memory Access (DMA) Controller__...

```c
  //  Init DMA for the ADC Channel for Single-Channel Conversion Mode
  rc = bl_adc_dma_init(1, ADC_SAMPLES);
  assert(rc == 0);
```

(First parameter of `bl_adc_dma_init` is the ADC Mode)

We configure the GPIO Pin for __ADC Input__...

```c
  //  Configure the GPIO Pin as ADC Input, no pullup, no pulldown
  rc = bl_adc_gpio_init(ADC_GPIO);
  assert(rc == 0);
```

We set the __DMA Context__ for the ADC Channel...

```c
  //  Get the ADC Channel Number for the GPIO Pin
  int channel = bl_adc_get_channel_by_gpio(ADC_GPIO);

  //  Get the DMA Context for the ADC Channel
  adc_ctx_t *ctx = bl_dma_find_ctx_by_channel(ADC_DMA_CHANNEL);
  assert(ctx != NULL);

  //  Indicate that the GPIO has been configured for ADC
  ctx->chan_init_table |= (1 << channel);
```

(`bl_dma_find_ctx_by_channel` is defined in [BL602 DMA HAL](https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/blob/master/components/hal_drv/bl602_hal/bl_dma.c))

Finally we __start the ADC Channel__...

```c
  //  Start reading the ADC via DMA
  bl_adc_start();
}
```

BL602 ADC Controller will __read the ADC Samples continuously__ (from the GPIO Pin) into RAM (until we stop the ADC Channel).

## Read the ADC Channel

_After starting the ADC Channel, how do we fetch the ADC Samples that have been read?_

Let's find out in [`demo.c`](https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/blob/adc/customer_app/sdk_app_adc2/sdk_app_adc2/demo.c#L79-L116) ...

```c
/// Command to compute the average value of the ADC Samples that have just been read.
/// Based on `hal_adc_get_data` in <https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/blob/master/components/hal_drv/bl602_hal/hal_adc.c#L142-L179>
void read_adc(char *buf, int len, int argc, char **argv) {
  //  Get the ADC Channel Number for the GPIO Pin
  int channel = bl_adc_get_channel_by_gpio(ADC_GPIO);
    
  //  Get the DMA Context for the ADC Channel
  adc_ctx_t *ctx = bl_dma_find_ctx_by_channel(ADC_DMA_CHANNEL);
  assert(ctx != NULL);

  //  Verify that the GPIO has been configured for ADC
  assert(((1 << channel) & ctx->chan_init_table) != 0);
```

Our __`read_adc` Command__ begins by verifying the __DMA Context__ for the ADC Channel.

Next we check whether the __ADC Sampling__ has been completed for the ADC Channel...

```c
  //  If ADC Sampling is not finished, try again later    
  if (ctx->channel_data == NULL) {
    printf("ADC Sampling not finished\r\n");
    return;
  }
```

Remember that the BL602 ADC Controller will __read ADC Samples continuously__ and write the last 1,000 samples to RAM (via DMA).

Let's __copy the last 1,000 ADC Samples__ from the DMA Context (in RAM) to a Static Array `adc_data`...

```c
  //  Static array that will store 1,000 ADC Samples
  static uint32_t adc_data[ADC_SAMPLES];

  //  Copy the read ADC Samples to the static array
  memcpy(
    (uint8_t*) adc_data,             //  Destination
    (uint8_t*) (ctx->channel_data),  //  Source
    sizeof(adc_data)                 //  Size
  );  
```

Then we compute the __average value of the ADC Samples__ in `adc_data`...

```c
  //  Compute the average value of the ADC Samples
  uint32_t sum = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < ADC_SAMPLES; i++) {
    //  Scale up the ADC Sample to the range 0 to 3199
    uint32_t scaled = ((adc_data[i] & 0xffff) * 3200) >> 16;
    sum += scaled;
  }
  printf("Average: %lu\r\n", (sum / ADC_SAMPLES));
}
```

The default ADC Configuration has roughly __12 Bits of Resolution per ADC Sample__.

Thus we scale each ADC Sample to the range __0 to 3199__.

And that's how we code BL602 ADC Firmware in C!

![Running the BL602 ADC Firmware in C](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/adc-demo.png)

## Run the C Firmware

Watch what happens when we __flash and run__ the C Firmware for BL602 ADC: [`sdk_app_adc2`](https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/blob/adc/customer_app/sdk_app_adc2/)

1.  Enter this command to __initialise the ADC Channel__...

    ```text
    # init_adc
    ```

    (We've seen this function earlier)

1.  Place the BL602 Board (with LED) in a __dark place__.

1.  Enter the `read_adc` command a few times to get the __average values__ of the last 1,000 ADC Samples...

    ```text
    # read_adc
    Average: 1416

    # read_adc
    Average: 1416

    # read_adc
    Average: 1416
    ```

1.  Now place the BL602 Board (with LED) __under sunlight__.

1.  Enter the `read_adc` command a few times...

    ```text
    # read_adc
    Average: 1408

    # read_adc
    Average: 1408

    # read_adc
    Average: 1408
    ```

    Note that the average values have __dropped from 1416 to 1408.__

1.  Place the BL602 Board (with LED) __back in the dark__ and check the average values...

    ```text
    # read_adc
    Average: 1417

    # read_adc
    Average: 1416

    # read_adc
    Average: 1416
    ```

    The average values have __increased from 1408 to 1416.__

    Yep our improvised BL602 Light Sensor works!

## Set the ADC Gain

Let's chat about __ADC Gain__, which we used when reading the LED as a Light Sensor. 

(ADC Gain probably won't be needed for reading most types of ADC Inputs)

_Why do we need ADC Gain when reading an LED?_

Our LED generates a __tiny bit of current__ when exposed to light. To measure that tiny bit of current, we need to increase the ADC sensitivity.

Thus we __increase the ADC Gain__. (By default there's no ADC Gain)

_BL602 HAL has a function that sets the ADC Gain right?_

Sadly no. We need to go really low-level and call the [__BL602 Standard Driver for ADC__](https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/blob/master/components/bl602/bl602_std/bl602_std/StdDriver/Src/bl602_adc.c#L152-L230).

(The BL602 Standard Driver directly manipulates the BL602 Hardware Registers)

Here's the low-level code that __sets the ADC Gain__: [`demo.c`](https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/blob/adc/customer_app/sdk_app_adc2/sdk_app_adc2/demo.c#L118-L146)

```c
/// Enable ADC Gain to increase the ADC sensitivity.
/// Based on ADC_Init in <https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/blob/master/components/bl602/bl602_std/bl602_std/StdDriver/Src/bl602_adc.c#L152-L230>
static int set_adc_gain(uint32_t gain1, uint32_t gain2) {
  //  Read the ADC Configuration Hardware Register
  uint32_t reg = BL_RD_REG(AON_BASE, AON_GPADC_REG_CONFIG2);

  //  Set the ADC Gain
  reg = BL_SET_REG_BITS_VAL(reg, AON_GPADC_PGA1_GAIN, gain1);
  reg = BL_SET_REG_BITS_VAL(reg, AON_GPADC_PGA2_GAIN, gain2);

  //  Set the ADC Chop Mode
  if (gain1 != ADC_PGA_GAIN_NONE || gain2 != ADC_PGA_GAIN_NONE) {
    reg = BL_SET_REG_BITS_VAL(reg, AON_GPADC_CHOP_MODE, 2);
  } else {
    reg = BL_SET_REG_BITS_VAL(reg, AON_GPADC_CHOP_MODE, 1);        
  }

  //  Enable the ADC PGA
  reg = BL_CLR_REG_BIT(reg, AON_GPADC_PGA_VCMI_EN);
  if (gain1 != ADC_PGA_GAIN_NONE || gain2 != ADC_PGA_GAIN_NONE) {
    reg = BL_SET_REG_BIT(reg, AON_GPADC_PGA_EN);
  } else {
    reg = BL_CLR_REG_BIT(reg, AON_GPADC_PGA_EN);
  }

  //  Update the ADC Configuration Hardware Register
  BL_WR_REG(AON_BASE, AON_GPADC_REG_CONFIG2, reg);
  return 0;
}
```

# Create a BL602 Rust Project

Before diving into the Rust Firmware, let's walk through the steps for __creating a BL602 Rust Project__ (like `sdk_app_rust_adc`)...

1.  __Copy the Project Folder__ for an existing Rust Project, like `sdk_app_rust_gpio` ...

    -   [__Project Folder for `sdk_app_rust_gpio`__](https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/blob/adc/customer_app/sdk_app_rust_gpio)

1.  __Paste the Project Folder__ into __`bl_iot_sdk/customer_app`__ and rename it (like `sdk_app_rust_adc`)...

    ![BL602 Rust Project](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/adc-project.png)

    Be sure to __rename the Sub Folder__ too. (The `sdk_app_rust_adc` inside `sdk_app_rust_adc`)

    __Delete the `build_out` folder__ if it exists.

1.  __Edit the `Makefile`__ in the new folder and set the Project Name: [`sdk_app_rust_adc/Makefile`](https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/blob/adc/customer_app/sdk_app_rust_adc/Makefile)

    ```text
    #  Set the project name
    PROJECT_NAME := sdk_app_rust_adc
    ```

1.  Set the __GCC Compiler Options__ (if any) in the Makefile [`sdk_app_rust_adc / sdk_app_rust_adc / bouffalo.mk`](https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/blob/adc/customer_app/sdk_app_rust_adc/sdk_app_rust_adc/bouffalo.mk)

1.  Edit the __`run.sh` script__ in the new folder and set the Project Name: [`sdk_app_rust_adc/run.sh`](https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/blob/adc/customer_app/sdk_app_rust_adc/run.sh)

    ```bash
    #  Set the project name
    export APP_NAME=sdk_app_rust_adc
    ```

1.  Replace the __Rust Source Code__ in [`sdk_app_rust_adc/ rust/src/lib.rs`](https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/blob/adc/customer_app/sdk_app_rust_adc/rust/src/lib.rs) 

1.  Remember to edit __`README.md`__ and fill in the project details

# BL602 ADC in Rust

Now we study the __Rust Firmware for BL602 ADC__: [`sdk_app_rust_adc`](https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/blob/adc/customer_app/sdk_app_rust_adc)

We have __converted the C Firmware to Rust__ line by line, so the Rust code will look highly similar to C.

Recall that our firmware implements two commands...

1.  __Initialise the ADC Channel__ for reading our LED GPIO

1.  __Compute the average value__ of the ADC Samples that have been read

Here is the Rust implementation...

## Definitions

We start by declaring to the Rust Compiler that we're calling the __Rust Core Library__ (instead of Rust Standard Library): [`lib.rs`](https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/blob/adc/customer_app/sdk_app_rust_adc/rust/src/lib.rs#L1-L37)

```rust
#![no_std]  //  Use the Rust Core Library instead of the Rust Standard Library, which is not compatible with embedded systems
```

(Rust Standard Library is too heavy for embedded programs)

Next we __import the functions__ from Rust Core Library that will be used in a while...

```rust
//  Import Libraries
use core::{          //  Rust Core Library
  fmt::Write,        //  String Formatting    
  mem::transmute,    //  Pointer Casting
  panic::PanicInfo,  //  Panic Handler
};
```

We import the __Rust Wrapper for BL602 IoT SDK__...

```rust
use bl602_sdk::{     //  Rust Wrapper for BL602 IoT SDK
  adc,               //  ADC HAL
  dma,               //  DMA HAL
  puts,              //  Console Output
  Ptr,               //  C Pointer
  String,            //  Strings (limited to 64 chars)
};
```

We shall read __GPIO 11__ (the Blue LED) as ADC Input...

```rust
/// GPIO Pin Number that will be configured as ADC Input.
/// PineCone Blue LED is connected on BL602 GPIO 11.
/// PineCone Green LED is connected on BL602 GPIO 14.
/// Only these GPIOs are supported: 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15
/// TODO: Change the GPIO Pin Number for your BL602 board
const ADC_GPIO: i32 = 11;
```

BL602 ADC Controller shall read __10,000 ADC Samples per second__, and remember the last __100 ADC Samples__...

```rust
/// We set the ADC Frequency to 10 kHz according to <https://wiki.analog.com/university/courses/electronics/electronics-lab-led-sensor?rev=1551786227>
/// This is 10,000 samples per second.
const ADC_FREQUENCY: u32 = 10000;  //  Hz

/// We shall read 100 ADC samples, which will take 0.01 seconds
const ADC_SAMPLES: usize = 100;
```

(`usize` is similar to `size_t` in C, it's used to represent the size of arrays)

We shall set the __ADC Gain__ to increase the ADC sensitivity...

```rust
/// Set ADC Gain to Level 1 to increase the ADC sensitivity.
/// To disable ADC Gain, set `ADC_GAIN1` and `ADC_GAIN2` to `ADC_PGA_GAIN_NONE`.
/// See <https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/blob/master/components/bl602/bl602_std/bl602_std/StdDriver/Inc/bl602_adc.h#L133-L144>
const ADC_GAIN1: u32 = ADC_PGA_GAIN_1;
const ADC_GAIN2: u32 = ADC_PGA_GAIN_1;
```

But __`ADC_PGA_GAIN_1`__ is missing from our Rust Wrapper.

Thus we copy the value from BL602 IoT SDK and define it here...

```rust
const ADC_PGA_GAIN_1: u32 = 1;  //  From <https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/blob/master/components/bl602/bl602_std/bl602_std/StdDriver/Inc/bl602_adc.h#L133-L144>
```

## Initialise the ADC Channel

Here's our Rust Function __`init_adc`__ that will be called by the BL602 Command-Line Interface: [`lib.rs`](https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/blob/adc/customer_app/sdk_app_rust_adc/rust/src/lib.rs#L39-L100)

```rust
/// Command to init the ADC Channel and start reading the ADC Samples.
/// Based on `hal_adc_init` in <https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/blob/master/components/hal_drv/bl602_hal/hal_adc.c#L50-L102>
#[no_mangle]             //  Don't mangle the function name
extern "C" fn init_adc(  //  Declare `extern "C"` because it will be called by BL602 firmware
  _result: *mut u8,        //  Result to be returned to command-line interface (char *)
  _len:  i32,              //  Size of result buffer (int)
  _argc: i32,              //  Number of command line args (int)
  _argv: *const *const u8  //  Array of command line args (char **)
) {
  puts("[Rust] Init ADC");
```

(We won't be parsing the command-line arguments, so let's ignore the parameters passed to `init_adc`)

We start by validating the GPIO Pin Number and ADC Frequency...

```rust
  //  Only these GPIOs are supported: 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15
  assert!(ADC_GPIO==4 || ADC_GPIO==5 || ADC_GPIO==6 || ADC_GPIO==9 || ADC_GPIO==10 || ADC_GPIO==11 || ADC_GPIO==12 || ADC_GPIO==13 || ADC_GPIO==14 || ADC_GPIO==15);

  //  For Single-Channel Conversion Mode, frequency must be between 500 and 16,000 Hz
  assert!(ADC_FREQUENCY >= 500 && ADC_FREQUENCY <= 16000);
```

(Remember: Not all GPIOs are supported for ADC!)

Next we select __ADC Mode 1__ (Single-Channel Conversion) and set the __ADC Frequency__...

```rust
  //  Init the ADC Frequency for Single-Channel Conversion Mode
  adc::freq_init(1, ADC_FREQUENCY)
    .expect("ADC Freq failed");
```

We set the __ADC GPIO Pin Number__ for ADC Mode 1...

```rust
  //  Init the ADC GPIO for Single-Channel Conversion Mode
  adc::init(1, ADC_GPIO)
    .expect("ADC Init failed");
```

To increase the ADC sensitivity, we set the __ADC Gain__...

```rust
  //  Enable ADC Gain to increase the ADC sensitivity
  let rc = unsafe { set_adc_gain(ADC_GAIN1, ADC_GAIN2) };  //  Unsafe because we are calling C function
  assert!(rc == 0);
```

(This calls our C function `set_adc_gain`, which shall be explained below)

BL602 ADC Controller shall transfer the ADC Samples directly into RAM, thanks to the __Direct Memory Access (DMA) Controller__...

```rust
  //  Init DMA for the ADC Channel for Single-Channel Conversion Mode
  adc::dma_init(1, ADC_SAMPLES as u32)
    .expect("DMA Init failed");
```

(First parameter of `dma_init` is the ADC Mode)

We configure the GPIO Pin for __ADC Input__...

```rust
  //  Configure the GPIO Pin as ADC Input, no pullup, no pulldown
  adc::gpio_init(ADC_GPIO)
    .expect("ADC GPIO failed");
```

And we fetch the __DMA Context__ for the ADC Channel...

```rust
  //  Get the ADC Channel Number for the GPIO Pin
  let channel = adc::get_channel_by_gpio(ADC_GPIO)
    .expect("ADC Channel failed");

  //  Get the DMA Context for the ADC Channel
  let ptr = dma::find_ctx_by_channel(adc::ADC_DMA_CHANNEL as i32)
    .expect("DMA Ctx failed");
```

However the returned pointer `ptr` is actually a "`void *`" pointer from C.

To use the pointer in Rust, we cast it to a __DMA Context Pointer__...

```rust
  //  Cast the returned C Pointer (void *) to a DMA Context Pointer (adc_ctx *)
  let ctx = unsafe {     //  Unsafe because we are casting a pointer
    transmute::<         //  Cast the type...
      Ptr,               //  From C Pointer (void *)
      *mut adc::adc_ctx  //  To DMA Context Pointer (adc_ctx *)
    >(ptr)               //  For this pointer
  };
```

(More about `transmute` in the Appendix)

Now we may update the __DMA Context__ for the ADC Channel...

```rust
  //  Indicate that the GPIO has been configured for ADC
  unsafe {  //  Unsafe because we are dereferencing a pointer
    (*ctx).chan_init_table |= 1 << channel;
  }
```

(We flag this as `unsafe` because we're dereferencing a pointer: `ctx`)

Finally we __start the ADC Channel__...

```rust
  //  Start reading the ADC via DMA
  adc::start()
    .expect("ADC Start failed");
}
```

BL602 ADC Controller will __read the ADC Samples continuously__ (from the GPIO Pin) into RAM (until we stop the ADC Channel).

## Read the ADC Channel

_Our ADC Channel has been started, how do we average the ADC Samples that have been read?_

Let's check out the Rust Function __`read_adc`__ in [`lib.rs`](https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/blob/adc/customer_app/sdk_app_rust_adc/rust/src/lib.rs#L102-L165) ...

```rust
/// Command to compute the average value of the ADC Samples that have just been read.
/// Based on `hal_adc_get_data` in <https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/blob/master/components/hal_drv/bl602_hal/hal_adc.c#L142-L179>
#[no_mangle]              //  Don't mangle the function name
extern "C" fn read_adc(   //  Declare `extern "C"` because it will be called by BL602 firmware
  _result: *mut u8,        //  Result to be returned to command-line interface (char *)
  _len:  i32,              //  Size of result buffer (int)
  _argc: i32,              //  Number of command line args (int)
  _argv: *const *const u8  //  Array of command line args (char **)
) {
```

First we fetch the __DMA Context__ for the ADC Channel...

```rust
  //  Get the ADC Channel Number for the GPIO Pin
  let channel = adc::get_channel_by_gpio(ADC_GPIO)
    .expect("ADC Channel failed");
  
  //  Get the DMA Context for the ADC Channel
  let ptr = dma::find_ctx_by_channel(adc::ADC_DMA_CHANNEL as i32)
    .expect("DMA Ctx failed");
```

Again we cast the returned C pointer `ptr` to a __DMA Context Pointer__...

```rust
  //  Cast the returned C Pointer (void *) to a DMA Context Pointer (adc_ctx *)
  let ctx = unsafe {     //  Unsafe because we are casting a pointer
    transmute::<         //  Cast the type...
      Ptr,               //  From C Pointer (void *)
      *mut adc::adc_ctx  //  To DMA Context Pointer (adc_ctx *)
    >(ptr)               //  For this pointer
  };
```

(More about `transmute` in the Appendix)

Now we may verify the __DMA Context__ for the ADC Channel...

```rust
  //  Verify that the GPIO has been configured for ADC
  unsafe {  //  Unsafe because we are dereferencing a pointer
    assert!(((1 << channel) & (*ctx).chan_init_table) != 0);
  }
```

(We flag this as `unsafe` because we're dereferencing a pointer: `ctx`)

And we check whether the __ADC Sampling__ has been completed for the ADC Channel (`channel_data` shouldn't be null)...

```rust
  //  If ADC Sampling is not finished, try again later    
  if unsafe { (*ctx).channel_data.is_null() } {  //  Unsafe because we are dereferencing a pointer
    puts("ADC Sampling not finished");
    return;
  }
```

(Again we flag as `unsafe` because we're dereferencing the pointer `ctx`)

Remember that the BL602 ADC Controller will __read ADC Samples continuously__ and write the last 100 samples to RAM (via DMA).

We define an array `adc_data` to store the last 100 samples temporarily (on the stack)...

```rust
  //  Array that will store the last 100 ADC Samples
  //  (`ADC_SAMPLES` is 100)
  let mut adc_data: [u32; ADC_SAMPLES]
    = [0; ADC_SAMPLES];  //  Init array to 100 zeroes
```

(Rust requires all variables to be initialised, so we set the array to 100 zeroes)

Let's __copy the last 100 ADC Samples__ from the DMA Context (in RAM) to our array `adc_data` (on the stack)...

```rust
  //  Copy the read ADC Samples to the array
  unsafe {                    //  Unsafe because we are copying raw memory
    core::ptr::copy(          //  Copy the memory...
      (*ctx).channel_data,    //  From Source (ADC DMA data)
      adc_data.as_mut_ptr(),  //  To Destination (mutable pointer to adc_data)
      adc_data.len()          //  Number of Items (each item is uint32 or 4 bytes)
    );    
  }
```

(More about this in the Appendix)

(`adc_data.len()` returns the array length: 100)

Then we compute the __average value of the ADC Samples__ in `adc_data`...

```rust
  //  Compute the average value of the ADC Samples
  let mut sum = 0;
  for i in 0..ADC_SAMPLES {  //  From 0 to 99, `..` excludes 100
    //  Scale up the ADC Sample to the range 0 to 3199
    let scaled = ((adc_data[i] & 0xffff) * 3200) >> 16;
    sum += scaled;
  }
  let avg = sum / ADC_SAMPLES as u32;
```

We scale each ADC Sample to the range __0 to 3199__. (Because the default ADC Configuration produces 12-bit samples)

Finally we compose a __formatted string with the average value__ and display it...

```rust
  //  Format the output
  let mut buf = String::new();
  write!(buf, "[Rust] Average: {}", avg)
    .expect("buf overflow");

  //  Display the formatted output
  puts(&buf);
}
```

(Yep Rust will helpfully __check for buffer overflow__... safer than `sprintf`!)

Default String Size is __64 characters__, as defined in the BL602 Rust Wrapper.

(Similar to "`char[64]`" in C)

The __formatted output__ will appear like so...

And we're done... That's how we code BL602 ADC Firmware in Rust!

# Build the BL602 Rust Firmware

Here are the steps to build the BL602 Rust Firmware `sdk_app_rust_adc.bin`

1.  Install __`rustup`, `blflash` and `xpack-riscv-none-embed-gcc`__

    -   [__"Install rustup"__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/flash#install-rustup)

    -   [__"Download and build blflash"__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/flash#download-and-build-blflash)

    -   [__"Install `xpack-riscv-none-embed-gcc`"__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/debug#install-gdb)

1.  Download the __source code__ for the BL602 Rust Firmware...

    ```bash
    # Download the adc branch of lupyuen's bl_iot_sdk
    git clone --recursive --branch adc https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk
    cd bl_iot_sdk/customer_app/sdk_app_rust_adc
    ```

1.  Edit the script [__`run.sh`__](https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/blob/adc/customer_app/sdk_app_rust_adc/run.sh) in the `sdk_app_rust_adc` folder.

    This build script was created for macOS, but can be modified to run on Linux x64 and Windows WSL.

1.  In `run.sh`, set the following variables to the downloaded folders for `blflash` and `xpack-riscv-none-embed-gcc`...

    ```bash
    #  Where blflash is located
    export BLFLASH_PATH=$PWD/../../../blflash

    #  Where GCC is located
    export GCC_PATH=$PWD/../../../xpack-riscv-none-embed-gcc
    ```

    Save the changes into `run.sh`

1.  Build the firmware...

    ```bash
    ./run.sh
    ```

1.  We should see...

    ```text
    ----- Building Rust app and BL602 firmware for riscv32imacf-unknown-none-elf / sdk_app_rust_adc...

    ----- Build BL602 Firmware
    + make

    LD build_out/sdk_app_rust_adc.elf
    ld: undefined reference to `init_adc'
    ld: undefined reference to `read_adc'
    ----- Ignore undefined references to Rust Library
    ```

    This means that the __C code from our BL602 Firmware__ has been built successfully.

    [More details on building BL602 firmware](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/pinecone#building-firmware)

1.  Next the script __compiles our Rust code__ into a static library: `libapp.a`

    ```text
    ----- Build Rust Library
    + rustup default nightly

    + cargo build \
        --target ../riscv32imacf-unknown-none-elf.json \

    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 23.55s
    ```

1.  Finally the script __links the Rust static library__ into our BL602 firmware...

    ```text
    ----- Link BL602 Firmware with Rust Library
    + make
    use existing version.txt file

    ...
    Building Finish. To flash build output.
    ```

    Ignore the error from `blflash`, we'll fix this in a while.

1.  Our __BL602 Rust Firmware file__ has been generated at...

    ```text
    build_out/sdk_app_rust_adc.bin
    ```

    Let's flash this to BL602 and run it!

Check out the complete build log here...

![Building the BL602 Rust Firmware](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/adc-build.png)

# Flash the BL602 Rust Firmware

Here's how we flash the Rust Firmware file `sdk_app_rust_adc.bin` to BL602...

1.  Set BL602 to __Flashing Mode__ and restart the board...

    __For PineCone:__

    -   Set the __PineCone Jumper (IO 8)__ to the __`H` Position__ [(Like this)](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/pinecone-jumperh.jpg)

    -   Press the Reset Button

    __For BL10:__

    -   Connect BL10 to the USB port

    -   Press and hold the __D8 Button (GPIO 8)__

    -   Press and release the __EN Button (Reset)__

    -   Release the D8 Button

    __For Pinenut and MagicHome BL602:__

    -   Disconnect the board from the USB Port

    -   Connect __GPIO 8__ to __3.3V__

    -   Reconnect the board to the USB port

1.  __For macOS:__

    Enter this at the command prompt...

    ```bash
    ./run.sh
    ```

    The script should automatically flash the firmware after building...

    ```text

    (We might need to edit the script to use the right serial port)

1.  __For Linux and Windows:__

    Copy `build_out/sdk_app_rust_adc.bin` to the `blflash` folder.

    Then enter this at the command prompt...

    ```bash
    # TODO: Change this to the downloaded blflash folder
    cd blflash

    # For Linux:
    sudo cargo run flash sdk_app_lora.bin \
        --port /dev/ttyUSB0

    # For Windows: Change COM5 to the BL602 Serial Port
    cargo run flash sdk_app_lora.bin --port COM5
    ```

[More details on flashing firmware](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/flash#flash-the-firmware)

![Running the BL602 Rust Firmware](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/adc-demo2.png)

# Run the BL602 Rust Firmware

Finally we run the BL602 Rust Firmware...

1.  Set BL602 to __Normal Mode__ (Non-Flashing) and restart the board...

    __For PineCone:__

    -   Set the __PineCone Jumper (IO 8)__ to the __`L` Position__ [(Like this)](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/pinecone-jumperl.jpg)

    -   Press the Reset Button

    __For BL10:__

    -   Press and release the __EN Button (Reset)__

    __For Pinenut and MagicHome BL602:__

    -   Disconnect the board from the USB Port

    -   Connect __GPIO 8__ to __GND__

    -   Reconnect the board to the USB port

1.  __For macOS:__

    The `run.sh` script should automatically launch CoolTerm after flashing...

    ```text
    ----- Run BL602 Firmware
    + open -a CoolTerm
    ```

    [More about CoolTerm](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/flash#watch-the-firmware-run)

    __For Linux:__

    Connect to BL602's UART Port at 2 Mbps like so...

    ```bash
    sudo screen /dev/ttyUSB0 2000000
    ```

    __For Windows:__ 

    Use `putty` ([See this](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/flash#watch-the-firmware-run))

    __Alternatively:__ 

    Use the Web Serial Terminal ([See this](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/flash#watch-the-firmware-run))

    [More details on connecting to BL602](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/flash#watch-the-firmware-run)

1.  In the serial console, enter the `init_adc` command to __initialise the ADC Channel__...

    ```text
    # init_adc
    [Rust] Init ADC
    ```

    (We've seen this function earlier)

1.  Place the BL602 Board (with LED) in a __dark place__.

1.  Enter the `read_adc` command a few times to get the __average values__ of the last 1,000 ADC Samples...

    ```text
    # read_adc
    [Rust] Average: 1417
    # read_adc
    [Rust] Average: 1417
    # read_adc
    [Rust] Average: 1417
    ```

1.  Now place the BL602 Board (with LED) __under sunlight__.

1.  Enter the `read_adc` command a few times...

    ```text
    # read_adc
    [Rust] Average: 1411
    # read_adc
    [Rust] Average: 1411
    # read_adc
    [Rust] Average: 1412
    ```

    Note that the average values have __dropped from 1417 to 1412.__

1.  Place the BL602 Board (with LED) __back in the dark__ and check the average values...

    ```text
    # read_adc
    [Rust] Average: 1417
    # read_adc
    [Rust] Average: 1417
    # read_adc
    [Rust] Average: 1417
    ```

    The average values have __increased from 1412 to 1417.__

    Our improvised BL602 Light Sensor works in Rust yay!

# From C To Rust

_I'm new to Rust. Is there an easier way to jump from C to Rust?_

Today we've seen that it's feasible to __translate C Firmware into Rust__ line by line...

![Compare C and Rust](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/adc-compare.png)

Which is great for embedded developers new to Rust!

Just be mindful of the __differences between C and Rust__...

1.  __BL602 HAL Functions__ have been renamed for Rust.

    (Like "`bl_adc_init`" becomes "`adc::init`")

    To see the list of BL602 HAL Functions for Rust, [check out the `bl602-sdk` documentation](https://docs.rs/bl602-sdk).

    (More about this in the next chapter)

1.  In Rust we check for __BL602 HAL Errors__ by calling "`expect`" instead of "`assert`".

    (Rust Compiler will warn us if we forget to "`expect`")

1.  Rust is __super strict about Mutability__... Only variables and pointers declared "`mut`" can be changed.

    (That's why we write "`*mut i32`" to get a pointer to an integer whose value may be changed)

1.  __Pointer Deferencing__ like "`ptr->field`" doesn't work in Rust.

    We rewrite it in Rust as "`(*ptr).field`"

1.  Rust will helpfully __check for Buffer Overflow__.

    (No more silent "`sprintf`" overflow!)

    For BL602 Rust Wrapper the default string size is __64 characters__.

    (Similar to "`char[64]`" in C)

1.  All Rust variables shall be __initialised__ before use.

    (Even arrays and structs!)

Let's talk about "`unsafe`" code in Rust... 

## Safer Rust

Rust reminds us to be Extra Careful when we work with __C Functions and C Pointers__.

That's why we need to flag the following code as __`unsafe`__...

1.  __Calling C Functions__

    ```rust
    //  Call the C function `set_adc_gain`
    unsafe { set_adc_gain(ADC_GAIN1, ADC_GAIN2) };
    ```

    (More about this in the Appendix)

1.  __Casting C Pointers__ to Rust
    
    ```rust
    //  Cast a C Pointer to a Rust Pointer
    let ctx = unsafe {
      transmute::<         //  Cast the type...
        Ptr,               //  From C Pointer (void *)
        *mut adc::adc_ctx  //  To DMA Context Pointer (adc_ctx *)
      >(ptr)               //  For this pointer
    };
    ```

    (More about this in the Appendix)

1.  __Dereferencing C Pointers__

    ```rust
    //  Dereference a C Pointer (ctx)
    unsafe {
      (*ctx).chan_init_table = ...
    }
    ```

1.  __Copying Memory__ with C Pointers

    ```rust
    //  Copy memory with a C Pointer (channel_data)
    unsafe {
      core::ptr::copy(          //  Copy the memory...
        (*ctx).channel_data,    //  From Source (ADC DMA data)
        adc_data.as_mut_ptr(),  //  To Destination (mutable pointer to adc_data)
        adc_data.len()          //  Number of Items (each item is uint32 or 4 bytes)
      );    
    }
    ```

Accessing __Static Variables__ is also "`unsafe`". Let's talk about this...

## Static Variables in Rust

Earlier we saw this Rust code for __averaging the ADC Samples__...

```rust
//  `adc_data` will store 100 ADC Samples (`ADC_SAMPLES` is 100)
let mut adc_data: [u32; ADC_SAMPLES] = [0; ADC_SAMPLES];

//  Omitted: Copy data into `adc_data`
...

//  Compute average of `adc_data`
for i in 0..ADC_SAMPLES {
  //  Get value from `adc_data`
  let scaled = adc_data[i] & ...
```

Note that __`adc_data` lives on the stack__.

That's a huge chunk of data on the stack... __400 bytes!__

_What if we turn `adc_data` into a Static Array?_

We convert `adc_data` to a Static Array like this...

```rust
//  `adc_data` becomes a Static Array
static mut adc_data: [u32; ADC_SAMPLES] = [0; ADC_SAMPLES];
```

`adc_data` no longer lives on the stack, it's now in Static Memory.

_What's the catch?_

Unfortunately __Static Variables in Rust are `unsafe`__.

Thus all references to `adc_data` must be __flagged as `unsafe`__...

```rust
//  `adc_data` is now unsafe because it's a Static Variable
let scaled = unsafe { adc_data[i] } & ...
```

Which makes the code harder to read. That's why we left `adc_data` on the stack for this tutorial.

_Why are Static Variables `unsafe`?_

Because it's potentially possible to execute the above code in __multiple tasks__...

Which produces undefined behaviour when multiple tasks __access the same Static Variable__.

So it's perfectly OK to use Static Variables in Rust. Just that we need to...

1.  Flag the Static Variables as __`unsafe`__

1.  Ensure ourselves that Static Variables are only accessed by __one task at a time__

![Rust Wrapper for BL602 IoT SDK](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/adc-crate.png)

# Rust Wrapper for BL602 IoT SDK

_The Rust Functions for BL602 look mighty similar to the C Functions from the BL602 IoT SDK. How is this possible?_

Because the Rust Functions were __automatically generated from BL602 IoT SDK!__

We ran a script to generate the __Rust Wrapper for BL602 IoT SDK__.

And we published the Rust Wrapper on __`crates.io`__...

_Is the BL602 Rust Wrapper documented?_

Yep! Every Rust Function is linked to the section in [__"The RISC-V BL602 Book"__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/book) that explains how we call the function...

-   [__Documentation for BL602 Rust Wrapper__](https://docs.rs/bl602-sdk)

(Check the Appendix to learn more about the BL602 Rust Wrapper)

Here's a sample project that calls the Rust Wrapper for GPIO...

1.  ESP32 has something similar to the BL602 Rust Wrapper...

    -   [`esp-idf-sys`](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-idf-sys) defines the Rust Bindings for ESP32 IDF SDK (generated with `bindgen`)

    -   [`esp-idf-hal`](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-idf-hal) wraps `esp-idf-sys` into a Rust Embedded HAL for ESP32

# Appendix: Call C Functions from Rust

TODO

From [`lib.rs`](https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/blob/adc/customer_app/sdk_app_rust_adc/rust/src/lib.rs#L64-L66)

```rust
//  Enable ADC Gain to increase the ADC sensitivity
unsafe { set_adc_gain(ADC_GAIN1, ADC_GAIN2) };  //  Unsafe because we are calling C function
```

From [`lib.rs`](https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/blob/adc/customer_app/sdk_app_rust_adc/rust/src/lib.rs#L180-L184)

```rust
extern "C" {  //  Import C Function
  /// Enable ADC Gain to increase the ADC sensitivity.
  /// Defined in customer_app/sdk_app_rust_adc/sdk_app_rust_adc/demo.c
  fn set_adc_gain(gain1: u32, gain2: u32) -> i32;

# Appendix: Convert C Pointers to Rust

TODO

From [`lib.rs`](https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/blob/adc/customer_app/sdk_app_rust_adc/rust/src/lib.rs#L119-L129)

```rust
//  Get the C Pointer (void *) for DMA Context
