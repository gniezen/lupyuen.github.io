# Rust on RISC-V BL602: Is It Sunny?

üìù _8 Aug 2021_

Today we shall magically transform __any RISC-V BL602 Board__ into a __Light Sensor!__

We'll build this in C, then __port it to Rust.__

_Wait... Do all BL602 Boards have an onboard Light Sensor?_

Nope, all we need is a __BL602 Board with an LED__!

Reading the LED with BL602's __Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)__ will turn it into a __simple, improvised Light Sensor.__ Amazing!

_Will this work with any BL602 Board?_

I tested this with __PineCone BL602__ and its onboard LED.

It will probably work with any BL602 Board with an __onboard or external LED.__

_Will our Light Sensor detect any kind of light?_

Our LED-turned-Light-Sensor works best for __detecting sunlight__.

(Yep It's Always Sunny in Singapore ... So this Sunlight Sensor won't be so useful in Singapore üòÇ)
