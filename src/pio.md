Let's dive into our __NuttX Porting Journal__ and learn how we blinked the PinePhone LEDs...

# What's Next

TODO: GPIO Driver

TODO: MIPI DSI: I have zero idea what I'm doing... But it would be super hilarious if it works!

There's plenty to be done for NuttX on PinePhone, please lemme know if you would like to join me üôè
