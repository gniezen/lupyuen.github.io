_Pine64 PineDio Stack BL604 RISC-V Board_

__PineDio Stack BL604__ is Pine64's newest microcontroller board, based on [__Bouffalo Lab's BL604__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/pinecone) RISC-V + WiFi + Bluetooth LE SoC.

(Available any day now!)

PineDio Stack is packed __chock-full of features__...

-   ST7789 __Colour LCD Display__

    (240 x 240 pixels)

-   CST816S __Touch Panel__

    (Connected on I2C)

-   Semtech SX1262 __LoRa Transceiver__

    (Works with LoRaWAN)

-   AT6558 __GPS / GNSS Receiver__

-   SGM40561 __Power Management Unit__

-   __Heart Rate Sensor, Accelerometer, Compass, Vibrator__

-   __SPI Flash, JTAG Debugging Port, Push Button__

-   __2.4 GHz WiFi, Bluetooth LE__

    (Thanks to BL604)

Which makes it an incredible gadget for __IoT Education__!

(It looks like a __"Chonky PineTime"__, because it uses the same display and touch panel as PineTime!)

Today we shall run the open-source, community-supported [__Apache NuttX RTOS__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/nuttx) (Real-Time Operating System) on PineDio Stack...

And get started on creating __our own IoT Apps__!
