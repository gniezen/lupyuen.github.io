# IoT Digital Twin with Roblox and The Things Network

üìù _12 Oct 2021_

[__Roblox__](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/) is a Multiplayer Virtual World that lets us create 3D Objects and interact with them. (Free to play)

[__The Things Network__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/ttn) is a Public Wireless Network that connects many IoT Gadgets around the world. (Free for Fair Use)

_Can we connect Roblox to The Things Network... To Monitor and Control Real-World Gadgets?_

We shall head back and transmit BL602 / BL604's __Internal Temperature Sensor Data__ to The Things Network.
