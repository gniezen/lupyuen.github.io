# Machine Learning on RISC-V BL602 with TensorFlow Lite

📝 _22 Jun 2021_

_How a Human teaches a Machine to light up an LED..._

> _Human:_ Hello Machine, please light up the LED in a fun and interesting way

> _Machine:_ OK I shall light up the LED: on - off - on -off - on - off...

![On - Off - On - Off](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/tflite-chart1.jpg)

> _Human:_ That's not very fun and interesting

> _Machine:_ OK Hooman... Define fun and interesting

> _Human:_ Make the LED glow gently brighter and dimmer, brighter and dimmer, and so on

> _Machine:_ Like a wavy curve? Please teach me to draw a wavy curve

> _Human:_ Like this...

> _Machine:_ OK I have been trained. I shall now use my trained model to infer the values of the wavy curve. And light up the LED in a fun and interesting way.

This sounds like Science Fiction... But this is possible today!

(Except for the polite banter)

Read on to learn out how Machine Learning (TensorFlow Lite) makes this possible on the BL602 RISC-V SoC.
