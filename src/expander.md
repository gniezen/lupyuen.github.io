[__PineDio Stack BL604__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/pinedio2) (Pine64's newest RISC-V board) has an interesting problem on [__Apache NuttX RTOS__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/nuttx)... Too many GPIOs!

Let's fix this with a __GPIO Expander__.

_Why too many GPIOs?_

All __23 GPIOs__ on PineDio Stack BL604 are wired up...

-   [__"PineDio Stack GPIO Assignment"__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/pinedio2#appendix-gpio-assignment)

_NuttX can't handle 23 GPIOs?_

Well it gets messy. Without GPIO Expander, BL604 on NuttX supports one __GPIO Input__, one __GPIO Output__ and one __GPIO Interrupt__.

And they are __named sequentially__ (Input first, then Output, then Interrupt)...

-   __/dev/gpio0__: GPIO Input

-   __/dev/gpio1__: GPIO Output

-   __/dev/gpio2__: GPIO Interrupt

(See pic above)

_This looks OK?_

Until we realise that they map to __totally different GPIO Pins__ on PineDio Stack!

| GPIO Device | BL604 GPIO Pin | Function
|-------------|:----------:|-------
| __/dev/gpio0__ | GPIO Pin __`10`__ | SX1262 Busy
| __/dev/gpio1__ | GPIO Pin __`15`__ | SX1262 Chip Select
| __/dev/gpio2__ | GPIO Pin __`19`__ | SX1262 Interrupt

Extend this to __23 GPIOs__ and we have a mapping disaster!

Let's simplify this setup and map GPIO Pins 0 to 22 as "__/dev/gpio0__" to "__/dev/gpio22__". We'll do this with a __GPIO Expander__.

_What's a GPIO Expander?_
