_Can we create a Zig program visually... The Drag-n-Drop way?_

Let's find out! Today we shall explore [__Blockly__](https://developers.google.com/blockly), the Scratch-like browser-based coding toolkit.

And how we might customise Blockly to __create Zig programs__ visually.

_Will it work for any Zig program?_

We're not quite done yet. We hit some interesting challenges, like with Blockly's "Typelessness".

But it might work for creating __IoT Sensor Apps__ for Embedded Platforms. (Like Apache NuttX RTOS)

(More about this below)

Let's head down into our experiment with Blocky...
