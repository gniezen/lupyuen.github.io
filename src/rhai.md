# Rust on RISC-V BL602: Rhai Scripting

üìù _7 Sep 2021_

_What is Rhai?_

[__Rhai__](https://rhai.rs/book/) is a __Rust-like Scripting Language__, implemented in Rust.

_Can we use Rhai for coding microcontrollers the REPL way?_

_Like on the BL602 / BL604 RISC-V + WiFi + Bluetooth LE SoC?_

Sadly the Rhai Scripting Engine is __too heavy__ for most microcontrollers (including BL602 and BL604).

_What if we auto-convert Rhai Scripts to uLisp, which runs OK on microcontrollers?_

__Transpile Rhai to uLisp__... What an intriguing idea! Which we shall explore in this article.

_Let's make Rhai Scripting more fun for learners..._

_Can we drag-and-drop Rhai Scripts (the Scratch way) and run them on BL602?_

Yep it sounds feasible, let's explore that too.

_One more thing... Can we run Rhai Scripts in a Web Browser? Like on a Simulated BL602?_

Yes we can... Because we've implemented a __BL602 Simulator in WebAsssembly__!

-   ["Rust on RISC-V BL602: Simulated with WebAssembly"](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/rustsim)

So today we shall explore...

1.  Running __Rhai Scripts on BL602__

    (The REPL way)

1.  By __Auto-Converting Rhai Scripts to uLisp__

    (Because Rhai can't run directly on BL602)

1.  With __Drag-and-Drop Rhai Scripting__

    (The Scratch way)

1.  That also runs __Rhai Scripts in a Web Browser__

    (With BL602 simulated in WebAssembly)

# Bestest Outcome

_Why are we doing all this?_

# What's Next

TODO

And soon we shall test all this on [__PineDio Stack BL604 with LoRa SX1262__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/pinedio)... As we explore whether it's feasible to teach __Rust (or Rhai) as a Safer Way__ to create firmware for BL602 and BL604.
