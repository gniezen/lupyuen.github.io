A month ago we started porting __Apache Mynewt__, a modern embedded operating system, to PineCone BL602...

-   [__"Porting Mynewt to PineCone BL602"__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/mynewt)

Then last week we learnt about the __Hardware Abstraction Layer__ provided by the __BL602 IoT SDK__ for controlling GPIO...

-   [__"Control PineCone BL602 RGB LED with GPIO and PWM"__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/led)

Today we shall...

1.   __Embed BL602's Hardware Abstraction Layer__ inside Mynewt

1.   __Map Mynewt's GPIO Functions__ to BL602's Hardware Abstraction Layer
