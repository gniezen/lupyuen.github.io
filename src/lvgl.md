[__LVGL__](https://docs.lvgl.io/master/) is a popular __GUI Library__ in C that powers the User Interfaces of many Embedded Devices. [(Like smartwatches)](https://lupyuen.github.io/pinetime-rust-mynewt/articles/cloud#modify-the-pinetime-source-code)

[__Zig__](https://ziglang.org) is a new-ish Programming Language that works well with C. And it comes with built-in [__Safety Checks__](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Undefined-Behavior) at runtime.

_Can we use Zig to code an LVGL Touchscreen App?_

_Maybe wrap the LVGL API in Zig, making it a little safer and friendlier?_

_Or will we get blocked by something beyond our control? (Like Bit Fields in C Structs)_

Let's find out! We'll do this on Pine64's [__PineDio Stack BL604__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/pinedio2) RISC-V Board (pic above) with [__Apache NuttX RTOS__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/pinedio2).

(The steps should be similar for other platforms)
