_Apache NuttX RTOS booting on Pine64 PinePhone_

Suppose we're creating our own Operating System (non-Linux)  for Pine64 PinePhone...

-   What's the file format?
-   Where in RAM should it run?
-   Can we make a microSD that will boot our OS?
-   What happens when PinePhone powers on?

This article explains how we ported Apache NuttX RTOS to PinePhone. And we'll answer these questions along the way!

Let's dive in and walk through the steps...

# Allwinner A64 SoC

_What's inside PinePhone?_

At the heart of PinePhone is the [__Allwinner A64 SoC__](https://linux-sunxi.org/A64) (System-on-a-Chip) with 4 Cores of 64-bit __Arm Cortex-A53__...

-   [__PinePhone Wiki__](https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/PinePhone)

-   [__Allwinner A64 Info__](https://linux-sunxi.org/A64)

-   [__Allwinner A64 User Manual__](https://linux-sunxi.org/File:Allwinner_A64_User_Manual_V1.1.pdf)

The A64 SoC in PinePhone comes with __2GB RAM__ (or 3GB RAM via a mainboard upgrade)...

-   [__Allwinner A64 Memory Map__](https://linux-sunxi.org/A64/Memory_map)

A64's __Memory Map__ says that the RAM starts at address __`0x4000` `0000`__.

_So our OS will run at `0x4000` `0000`?_

Not quite! Our OS will actually be loaded at __`0x4008` `0000`__

We'll see why in a while, but first we talk about a Very Important Cable...

# USB Serial Debug Cable

_Can we watch what happens when PinePhone boots?_

There's a magical cable for that: __USB Serial Debug Cable__ (pic above)...

-   [__PinePhone Serial Debug Cable__](https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/PinePhone#Serial_console)

It connects to PinePhone's __Headphone Port__ (pic below) and exposes PinePhone's hidden __UART Port.__ Genius!

[(Remember to flip the Headphone Switch to OFF)](https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/PinePhone#Privacy_switch_configuration)

I highly recommend the USB Serial Debug Cable for __PinePhone Hacking__.

_What secrets will the Debug Cable reveal?_

We'll find out shortly! First we need to prep our microSD Card for hacking...

# PinePhone Jumpdrive

TODO

We'll analyse the Linux Kernel in the __PinePhone Jumpdrive Image__, since it's small...

-   [__dreemurrs-embedded/Jumpdrive__](https://github.com/dreemurrs-embedded/Jumpdrive)

Here are the steps...

1.  Download [__`pine64-pinephone.img.xz`__](https://github.com/dreemurrs-embedded/Jumpdrive/releases/download/0.8/pine64-pinephone.img.xz)

1.  Extract the files from the microSD Image with [__Balena Etcher__](https://www.balena.io/etcher/)

# What's Next

__NuttX on PinePhone__ might take a while to become a __Daily Driver__...

But today NuttX is ready to turn PinePhone into a valuable __Learning Resource__!

There's plenty to be done for NuttX on PinePhone, please lemme know if you would like to join me üôè
