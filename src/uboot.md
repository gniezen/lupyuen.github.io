Suppose we're creating our own Operating System (non-Linux)  for Pine64 PinePhone...

-   What's the file format?
-   Where in RAM should it run?
-   Can we make a microSD that will boot our OS?
-   What happens when PinePhone powers on?

This article explains how we ported Apache NuttX RTOS to PinePhone. And we'll answer these questions along the way!

__NuttX on PinePhone__ might take a while to become a __Daily Driver__...

But today NuttX is ready to turn PinePhone into a valuable __Learning Resource__!

There's plenty to be done for NuttX on PinePhone, please lemme know if you would like to join me üôè
