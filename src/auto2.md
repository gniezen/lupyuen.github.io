TODO: Story

TODO: Pine64 is about to launch its most exciting RISC-V gadget: PineDio Stack BL604 RISC-V Board with LoRa and Touch Screen. Here's how we automatically flash and test every new release of Apache NuttX RTOS for PineDio Stack.

# What's Next

TODO

Now that we've fixed the GPIO problem with GPIO Expander, I hope it's a lot easier to create __NuttX Drivers and Apps__ on PineDio Stack.

Lemme know what you're building with PineDio Stack!
