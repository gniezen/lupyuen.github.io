# PineDio LoRa Gateway: Testing The Prototype

📝 _15 Nov 2021_

Previously we tested two new wireless gadgets by Pine64...

-   [__PineDio Stack BL604 RISC-V Board__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/lorawan2)

-   [__PineDio LoRa USB Adapter__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/usb)

Both gadgets transmit and receive small data packets over incredible distances thanks to [__LoRa__](https://lora-developers.semtech.com/documentation/tech-papers-and-guides/lora-and-lorawan/), the __Long-Range Low-Bandwidth__ wireless network.

[(Up to 5 km or 3 miles in urban areas... 15 km or 10 miles in rural areas!)](https://lora-developers.semtech.com/documentation/tech-papers-and-guides/lora-and-lorawan/)

Today we test the third prototype LoRa gadget by Pine64: [__PineDio LoRa Gateway__](https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/Pinedio#Gateway)

_What's a LoRa Gateway? How does it differ from other LoRa gadgets?_

PineDio Stack and Pinedio USB are perfectly fine for __Point-to-Point Wireless Communication__.

But if we need to __relay data packets__ to multiple devices or to the internet, we need a __LoRa Gateway__. (Like PineDio Gateway)

(It's like a WiFi Router, but for LoRa)

_LoRa works over the internet?_

Yes, when we connect PineDio Gateway to [__The Things Network__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/ttn), the free-to-use public global network for LoRa gadgets.

(We'll learn how in a while)

_The Things Network is a public LoRa network. Why do we need PineDio Gateway?_

Network Coverage for The Things Network can be __spotty in some regions__.

[(Check out the coverage map for The Things Network)](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/map)

Hopefully Pine64 will make PineDio Gateway highly affordable for __Schools, Workplaces and Homes__ to install everywhere... And __grow The Things Network!__

_What about other LoRa networks?_

TODO

Will be really interesting to see how we adapt LoRa Mesh Networks to support PineDio Gateway!

What's a LoRa Concentrator?

https://www.semtech.com/products/wireless-rf/lora-core/sx1302

The SX1302 is a digital baseband engine, capable of detecting and demodulating large amounts of LoRa® packets expected
in the IOT networks.

How do we get data out of the things network?
