# PineDio LoRa Gateway: Testing The Prototype

üìù _15 Nov 2021_

TODO

Why does it matter?

The only free-to-use global wireless network for IoT devices (and probably simple text messaging)

What's the catch?

Gateways
Some places have better coverage than others
It's up to us to fill in the blank spots

Affordable gateway

Schools, workplaces and homes

Pre-production

Will be really interesting to see how we adapt LoRa Mesh Networks to support PineDio Gateway!

What's a LoRa Concentrator?

https://www.semtech.com/products/wireless-rf/lora-core/sx1302

The SX1302 is a digital baseband engine, capable of detecting and demodulating large amounts of LoRa¬Æ packets expected
in the IOT networks.

How do we get data out of the things network?
