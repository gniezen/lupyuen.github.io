_Ghidra with Apache NuttX RTOS for Arm Cortex-A53_

[__Apache NuttX RTOS__](https://nuttx.apache.org/docs/latest/) (Real-Time Operating System) runs on 64-bit __Arm Cortex-A53__ with Multiple Cores...

-   [__NuttX on Arm Cortex-A53__](https://github.com/apache/incubator-nuttx/tree/master/boards/arm64/qemu/qemu-a53)

__Pine64 PinePhone__ is based on the [__Allwinner A64 SoC__](https://linux-sunxi.org/A64) with 4 Cores of Arm Cortex-A53...

-   [__PinePhone Wiki__](https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/PinePhone)

Will NuttX run on PinePhone? Let's find out!

_Why NuttX?_

NuttX is a __tiny operating system__. It might be a fun way to teach more people about the internals of Phone Operating Systems. (Without digging deep into the Linux Stack)

Someday we might have a cheap, fast, responsive and tweakable phone running on NuttX!

_But why an RTOS for PinePhone? What about drivers and apps?_

Yep we have interesting challenges running NuttX on PinePhone, we'll talk more below.

First we experiment with NuttX on Arm Cortex-A53, __emulated with QEMU__. Then we discuss how it might work on PinePhone...

NuttX is [POSIX Compliant](https://nuttx.apache.org/docs/latest/introduction/inviolables.html), so the developer experience feels very much like Linux. (But much smaller)

And NuttX everything runs in RAM, no File System needed. (For now)

# Build NuttX: Multi Core

We see each of the 4 Cores starting NuttX (CPU0 to CPU3). That's so cool!

(Can we use QEMU to partially emulate PinePhone? That would be extremely helpful!)

# Inside NuttX for Cortex-A53

TODO

Now we browse the Source Files for the implementation of Cortex-A53 on NuttX.

NuttX treats QEMU as a Target Board (as though it was a dev board). Here are the Source Files and Build Configuration for the QEMU Board...

-   [nuttx/boards/arm64/qemu/qemu-a53](https://github.com/apache/incubator-nuttx/tree/master/boards/arm64/qemu/qemu-a53)

(We'll clone this to create a Target Board for PinePhone)

The Board-Specific Drivers for QEMU are started in [qemu-a53/src/qemu_bringup.c](https://github.com/apache/incubator-nuttx/blob/master/boards/arm64/qemu/qemu-a53/src/qemu_bringup.c)

(We'll start the PinePhone Drivers here)

The QEMU Board calls the QEMU Architecture-Specific Drivers at...

-   [nuttx/arch/arm64/src/qemu](https://github.com/apache/incubator-nuttx/tree/master/arch/arm64/src/qemu)

The UART Driver is located at [qemu/qemu_serial.c](https://github.com/apache/incubator-nuttx/blob/master/arch/arm64/src/qemu/qemu_serial.c) and [qemu/qemu_lowputc.S](https://github.com/apache/incubator-nuttx/blob/master/arch/arm64/src/qemu/qemu_lowputc.S)

(For PinePhone we'll create a UART Driver for Allwinner A64 SoC. I2C, SPI and other Low-Level A64 Drivers will be located here too)

The QEMU Functions (Board and Architecture) call the Arm64 Architecture Functions at...

-   [nuttx/arch/arm64/src/common](https://github.com/apache/incubator-nuttx/tree/master/arch/arm64/src/common)

Which implements all kinds of Arm64 Features: [FPU](https://github.com/apache/incubator-nuttx/blob/master/arch/arm64/src/common/arm64_fpu.c), [Interrupts](https://github.com/apache/incubator-nuttx/blob/master/arch/arm64/src/common/arm64_gicv3.c), [MMU](https://github.com/apache/incubator-nuttx/blob/master/arch/arm64/src/common/arm64_mmu.c), [Tasks](https://github.com/apache/incubator-nuttx/blob/master/arch/arm64/src/common/arm64_task_sched.c), [Timers](https://github.com/apache/incubator-nuttx/blob/master/arch/arm64/src/common/arm64_arch_timer.c)...

(We'll reuse them for PinePhone)

# NuttX Image

TODO

Next we analyse the NuttX Image with [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/), to understand the NuttX Image Header and Startup Code.

Here's the [NuttX ELF Image `nuttx`](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-nuttx/releases/download/v1.0.0/nuttx) analysed by Ghidra...

![Top Part of NuttX Image Header](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/Screenshot%202022-08-22%20at%204.09.55%20PM.png)

Note that the NuttX Image jumps to `real_start` (to skip the Image Header)...

```text
40280000 4d 5a 00 91     add        x13,x18,#0x16
40280004 0f 00 00 14     b          real_start
```

`real_start` is defined at 0x4028 0040 with the Startup Code...

![Bottom Part of NuttX Image Header](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/arm-title.png)

We see something interesting: The Magic Number `ARM\x64` appears at address 0x4028 0038.

Searching the net for this Magic Number reveals that it's actually an Arm64 Linux Kernel Header!

When we refer to the [NuttX Arm64 Disassembly `nuttx.S`](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-nuttx/releases/download/v1.0.0/nuttx.S), we find happiness: [arch/arm64/src/common/arm64_head.S](https://github.com/lupyuen/incubator-nuttx/blob/pinephone/arch/arm64/src/common/arm64_head.S#L79-L117)

     *       it will be used when NuttX support device tree in the future
     *
     * This must be the very first address in the loaded image.

    .globl __start;
__start:

     */

    add     x13, x18, #0x16      /* the magic "MZ" signature */
    b       real_start           /* branch to kernel start */
    .quad   0x480000              /* Image load offset from start of RAM */
    .quad   _e_initstack - __start         /* Effective size of kernel image, little-endian */

    .long   0                    /* reserved */

real_start:
    /* Disable all exceptions and interrupts */
```

NuttX Image actually follows the Arm64 Linux Kernel Image Format! As defined here...

-   ["Booting AArch64 Linux"](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/arm64/booting.html)

Arm64 Linux Kernel Image contains a 64-byte header...

```text
u32 code0;                    /* Executable code */
u32 code1;                    /* Executable code */
u64 text_offset;              /* Image load offset, little endian */
u64 image_size;               /* Effective Image size, little endian */
u64 flags;                    /* kernel flags, little endian */
u64 res2      = 0;            /* reserved */
u64 res3      = 0;            /* reserved */
u64 res4      = 0;            /* reserved */
u32 magic     = 0x644d5241;   /* Magic number, little endian, "ARM\x64" */
u32 res5;                     /* reserved (used for PE COFF offset) */
```

Start of RAM is 0x4000 0000. The Image Load Offset in our NuttX Image Header is 0x48 0000 according to [arch/arm64/src/common/arm64_head.S](https://github.com/lupyuen/incubator-nuttx/blob/pinephone/arch/arm64/src/common/arm64_head.S#L107)

```text
    .quad   0x480000              /* Image load offset from start of RAM */
```

This means that our NuttX Image will be loaded at 0x4048 0000.

I wonder if this Image Load Offset should have been 0x28 0000? (Instead of 0x48 0000)

Remember that Ghidra (and the Arm Disassembly) says that our NuttX Image is actually loaded at 0x4028 0000. (Instead of 0x4048 0000)

RAM Size and RAM Start are defined in the NuttX Configuration: [boards/arm64/qemu/qemu-a53/configs/nsh_smp/defconfig](https://github.com/lupyuen/incubator-nuttx/blob/pinephone/boards/arm64/qemu/qemu-a53/configs/nsh_smp/defconfig#L47-L48)

```text
CONFIG_RAM_SIZE=134217728
CONFIG_RAM_START=0x40000000
```

That's 128 MB RAM. Which should fit inside PinePhone's 2 GB RAM.

The NuttX Image was built with this Linker Command, based on `make --trace`...

NuttX Image begins at `__start`, which is defined as 0x4028 0000 in the NuttX Linker Script: [boards/arm64/qemu/qemu-a53/scripts/dramboot.ld](https://github.com/lupyuen/incubator-nuttx/blob/pinephone/boards/arm64/qemu/qemu-a53/scripts/dramboot.ld#L30-L33)

```text
SECTIONS
{
  . = 0x40280000;  /* uboot load address */
  _start = .;
```

We'll change this to 0x4000 0000 for PinePhone, since Start of RAM is 0x4000 0000 and Image Load Offset is 0. (See below)

We've seen the NuttX Image (which looks like a Linux Kernel Image), let's compare with a PinePhone Linux Kernel Image and see how NuttX needs to be tweaked...

# PinePhone Image

TODO

Will NuttX run on PinePhone? Let's analyse a PinePhone Linux Kernel Image with Ghidra, to look at the Linux Kernel Header and Startup Code.

We'll use the PinePhone Jumpdrive Image, since it's small...

-   [dreemurrs-embedded/Jumpdrive](https://github.com/dreemurrs-embedded/Jumpdrive)

Download [pine64-pinephone.img.xz](https://github.com/dreemurrs-embedded/Jumpdrive/releases/download/0.8/pine64-pinephone.img.xz)

Expand `pine64-pinephone.img.xz`

Expand the files inside...

```bash
gunzip Image.gz
gunzip initramfs.gz
tar xvf initramfs
```

Import the uncompressed `Image` (Linux Kernel) into Ghidra.

For "Language" select AARCH64:LE:v8A:default...
-   Processor: AARCH64 
-   Variant: v8A 
-   Size: 64 
-   Endian: little 
-   Compiler: default

![For "Language" select AARCH64:LE:v8A:default](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/Screenshot%202022-08-22%20at%203.39.06%20PM.png)

Here's the Jumpdrive `Image` (Linux Kernel) in Ghidra...

![Jumpdrive Image in Ghidra](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/Screenshot%202022-08-22%20at%205.40.58%20PM.png)

According to the Linux Kernel Header...

-   ["Booting AArch64 Linux"](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/arm64/booting.html)

We see Linux Kernel Magic Number `ARM\x64` at offset 0x38.

Image Load Offset is 0, according to the header.

Start of RAM is 0x4000 0000 according to this Memory Map...

-   [__A64 Memory Map__](https://linux-sunxi.org/A64/Memory_map)

So we shift `Image` in Ghidra to start at 0x4000 0000...

-   Click Window > Memory Map

-   Click "ram"

-   Click the 4-Arrows icon ("Move a block to another address")

-   Change "New Start Address" to 40000000

![Change Start Address to 40000000](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/Screenshot%202022-08-21%20at%207.07.15%20PM.png)

Note that the first instruction at 0x4000 0000 jumps to 0x4081 0000 (to skip the Linux Kernel Header)...

```text
40000000 00 40 20 14     b          FUN_40810000
```

(Note: The magic "MZ" signature is not needed)

The Linux Kernel Code actually begins at 0x4081 0000...

![Linux Kernel Code actually begins at 0x4081 0000](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/Screenshot%202022-08-22%20at%205.53.58%20PM.png)

# Will NuttX Boot On PinePhone?

TODO

_So will NuttX boot on PinePhone?_

It's highly plausible! We discovered (with happiness) that NuttX already generates an Arm64 Linux Kernel Header.

So NuttX could be a drop-in replacement for the PinePhone Linux Kernel! We just need to...

-   Write PinePhone Jumpdrive to a microSD Card (with Etcher, in FAT format)

-   Overwrite `Image.gz` by the (gzipped) NuttX Binary Image `nuttx.bin.gz`

-   Insert the microSD Card into PinePhone

-   Power on PinePhone

And NuttX should (theoretically) boot on PinePhone!

As mentioned earlier, we should rebuild NuttX so that `__start` is changed to 0x4000 0000 (from 0x4028 0000), as defined in the NuttX Linker Script: [boards/arm64/qemu/qemu-a53/scripts/dramboot.ld](https://github.com/lupyuen/incubator-nuttx/blob/pinephone/boards/arm64/qemu/qemu-a53/scripts/dramboot.ld#L30-L33)

```text
SECTIONS
{
  /* TODO: Change to 0x4000000 for PinePhone */
  . = 0x40280000;  /* uboot load address */
  _start = .;
```

Also the Image Load Offset in our NuttX Image Header should be changed to 0x0 (from 0x48 0000): [arch/arm64/src/common/arm64_head.S](https://github.com/lupyuen/incubator-nuttx/blob/pinephone/arch/arm64/src/common/arm64_head.S#L107)

```text
    /* TODO: Change to 0x0 for PinePhone */
    .quad   0x480000              /* Image load offset from start of RAM */
```

We'll increase the RAM Size to 2 GB (from 128 MB): [boards/arm64/qemu/qemu-a53/configs/nsh_smp/defconfig](https://github.com/lupyuen/incubator-nuttx/blob/pinephone/boards/arm64/qemu/qemu-a53/configs/nsh_smp/defconfig#L47-L48)

```text
/* TODO: Increase to 2 GB for PinePhone */
CONFIG_RAM_SIZE=134217728
CONFIG_RAM_START=0x40000000
```

_But will we see anything when NuttX boots on PinePhone?_

Not yet. We'll need to implement the UART Driver for NuttX...

# UART Driver for NuttX

TODO

We won't see any output from NuttX until we implement the UART Driver for NuttX.

These are the Source Files for the QEMU UART Driver (PL011)...

-   [arch/arm64/src/qemu/qemu_serial.c](https://github.com/apache/incubator-nuttx/blob/master/arch/arm64/src/qemu/qemu_serial.c)

-   [arch/arm64/src/qemu/qemu_lowputc.S](https://github.com/apache/incubator-nuttx/blob/master/arch/arm64/src/qemu/qemu_lowputc.S)

    [(More about PL011 UART)](https://krinkinmu.github.io/2020/11/29/PL011.html)

We'll replace the code above with the UART Driver for Allwinner A64 SoC...

-   [UART0 Memory Map](https://linux-sunxi.org/A64/Memory_map)

-   [Allwinner A64 UART](https://linux-sunxi.org/UART)

-   [Allwinner A64 User Manual](https://linux-sunxi.org/File:Allwinner_A64_User_Manual_V1.1.pdf)

-   [Allwinner A64 Info](https://linux-sunxi.org/A64)

To access the UART Port on PinePhone, we'll use this USB Serial Debug Cable...

-   [PinePhone Serial Debug Cable](https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/PinePhone#Serial_console)

Which connects to the Headphone Port. Genius!

[(Remember to flip the Headphone Switch to OFF)](https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/PinePhone#Privacy_switch_configuration)

# PinePhone on RTOS

TODO

_Will an RTOS work well on Phones?_

[__BlackBerry 10__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackBerry_10) phones ran on [__QNX__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QNX), which is a Real-Time Operating System. (10 years ago!)

_What's an RTOS anyway?_

On a [__Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_operating_system), the Task Scheduling Behaviour is predictable. Like: Task X will be scheduled to run __within Y microseconds__.

An RTOS is not designed for High Processing Throughput. But it will guarantee (somewhat) that a Task will respond within a fixed period of time.

_What does it mean for PinePhone on RTOS?_

With an RTOS, I'm guessing the PinePhone User Interface will feel __more responsive__? And Incoming Calls and Text Messages will hopefully pop up quicker.

That assumes we'll assign the correct __Priority for each Task__. It sounds like we're micro-managing the resources on PinePhone, but I'm curious to see the actual outcome.

(And it will be super educational!)

_But NuttX might be too tiny for PinePhone?_

A tiny operating system (like NuttX), might be good for __teaching the internals__ of a Phone Operating System.

We might not get all PinePhone features to work.  But at least we'll understand every single feature that we built!

Tiny OSes are also easier to tweak. Think of the super-tweakable __PineTime Smartwatch__, which also runs on an RTOS. (FreeRTOS)

(Maybe someday PineTime, PinePhone and Pinebook Pro will run NuttX for __Educational Purposes__!)

# PinePhone Drivers and Apps

TODO

Here comes the hard part.

No drivers? Well PinePhone comes bundled with a fixed set of peripherals...

-   [__LCD Display / Touch Panel__](https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/PinePhone_component_list#P.11_LCM/CTP)

-   [__LTE Modem__](https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/PinePhone_component_list#P.15_MODEM-4G)

-   [__WiFi / BLE__](https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/PinePhone_component_list#P.14_WIFI+BT)

-   [__eMMC__](https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/PinePhone_component_list#P.7_NAND/eMMC)

-   [__Power Management__](https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/PinePhone_component_list#P.6_POWER)

And interfaces: UART, I2C, SPI, ...

Just build the drivers and we're done? (Yep I sound really naive now)

Just like PineDio Stack BL604: Display, Touch Panel, LoRaWAN, ...

No apps? Might be interesting to build PinePhone Apps the safer way with Zig

Simple apps might work with LVGL and Zig

TODO: From [__Alan Carvalho de Assis__](https://www.linkedin.com/in/acassis/)
