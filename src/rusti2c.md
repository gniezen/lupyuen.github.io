[__I2C__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C) is a great way to connect all kinds of __Sensor Modules__ when we're creating an __IoT Gadget__. Like sensors for temperature, humidity, light, motion, spectroscopy, GPS, ... [__and many more!__](https://www.sparkfun.com/categories/tags/i2c)

_But where will we get the Software Drivers for the I2C Sensors?_

[__Embedded Rust__](https://github.com/rust-embedded/awesome-embedded-rust#driver-crates) has a large collection of drivers for I2C Sensors. And they will work on __many platforms!__

Today we shall experiment with the Rust Driver for [__Bosch BME280 Sensor__](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/products/environmental-sensors/humidity-sensors-bme280/) (Temperature / Humdity / Air Pressure)... And learn how we made it work on the (Linux-like) [__Apache NuttX RTOS__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/nuttx).

We'll run this on the [__BL602 RISC-V SoC__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/pinecone) (pic above), though it should run OK on ESP32 and other NuttX platforms.

Let's dive into our __Rust App for NuttX__...
