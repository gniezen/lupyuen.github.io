# LoRa SX1262 on Apache NuttX OS

__LoRa__ is an awesome wireless technology for IoT that will transmit __small packets over very long distances__...

[(Up to 5 km or 3 miles in urban areas... 15 km or 10 miles in rural areas!)](https://lora-developers.semtech.com/documentation/tech-papers-and-guides/lora-and-lorawan/)

Let's port LoRa to __Apache NuttX OS!__

# What's Next

TODO

Now that we have NuttX talking OK to the SX1262 LoRa Transceiver... We're ready to port __LoRa and LoRaWAN__ to NuttX!

We'll port this LoRa + LoRaWAN Stack...

-   [__"PineCone BL602 Talks LoRaWAN"__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/lorawan)

Over the next couple of articles we shall __migrate the LoRa + LoRaWAN code incrementally__ to NuttX...

1.  Initially as a __NuttX App Library__ running in a NuttX App

    (Because it's easier to code and troubleshoot)

1.  Eventually moving into a __NuttX Device Driver__

    (Because it's The Right Thing)

1.  By implementing __ioctl()__ operations for LoRaWAN

    [(Similar to this SX1276 Device Driver)](https://github.com/apache/incubator-nuttx/blob/master/drivers/wireless/lpwan/sx127x/sx127x.c#L954-L1162)

I'm still super curious about porting the [__Rust Embedded HAL__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/nuttx#rust-on-nuttx) to NuttX. We might start soon with GPIO and SPI to see whether the concept is feasible.

Stay Tuned!

Many Thanks to my [__GitHub Sponsors__](https://github.com/sponsors/lupyuen) for supporting my work! This article wouldn't have been possible without your support.

# Notes

1.  This article is the expanded version of [this Twitter Thread](https://twitter.com/MisterTechBlog/status/1471179698268893188)

1.  We have already ported LoRaWAN to __BL602 IoT SDK__ [(see this)](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/lorawan), why are we porting again to NuttX?

    Regrettably BL602 IoT SDK has been revamped (without warning) to the __new "hosal" HAL__ [(see this)](https://twitter.com/MisterTechBlog/status/1456259223323508748), and the LoRaWAN Stack will __no longer work__ on the revamped BL602 IoT SDK.

    For easier maintenance, we shall __code our BL602 and BL604 projects with Apache NuttX OS__ instead.

    (Which won't get revamped overnight!)
