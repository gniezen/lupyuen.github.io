# SPI on Apache NuttX OS

üìù _12 Dec 2021_

Last article we explored __Apache NuttX OS__ and its __GPIO Functions__...

TODO

Today we shall venture into the __SPI Functions__ and discover...

-   How to __transmit and receive__ data over SPI

-   By coding a simple NuttX __Device Driver__

-   And testing with __Semtech SX1282__ (LoRa Transceiver)

-   On Bouffalo Lab's __BL602 and BL604__ RISC-V SoCs

_What about ESP32? NuttX works the same across platforms right?_

I realise that many of my readers are using ESP32 instead of BL602.

In this article I'll point out the tweaks needed to __run the code on ESP32__.

(Watch for the __"Xref"__ tags)

# What's Next

TODO

I'm new to NuttX but I had lots of fun experimenting with it. I hope you'll enjoy NuttX too!

Here are some topics I might explore in future articles, lemme know if I should do these...

-   __SPI Driver__: PineDio Stack BL604 has an onboard LoRa SX1262 Transceiver wired via SPI. Great way to test the NuttX SPI Driver for BL602 / BL604!

    [(More about PineDio Stack BL604)](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/lorawan2)

-   __LoRaWAN Driver__: Once we get SX1262 talking OK on SPI, we can port the LoRaWAN Driver to NuttX!

    [(LoRaWAN on PineDio Stack BL604)](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/lorawan2)

-   __Rust__: Porting the Embedded Rust HAL to NuttX sounds really interesting. We might start with GPIO and SPI to see whether the concept is feasible.

(BL602 IoT SDK / FreeRTOS is revamping right now to the [__new "hosal" HAL__](https://twitter.com/MisterTechBlog/status/1456259223323508748). Terrific time to explore NuttX now!)

Many Thanks to my [__GitHub Sponsors__](https://github.com/sponsors/lupyuen) for supporting my work! This article wouldn't have been possible without your support.
