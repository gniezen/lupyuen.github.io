# Zig on RISC-V BL602: Quick Peek with Apache NuttX RTOS

üìù _7 Jun 2022_

[__Zig__](https://ziglang.org) is a general-purpose language for maintaining __robust, optimal, and reusable software__.

[__BL602__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/pinecone) is a 32-bit __RISC-V SoC__.

Let's run __Zig on BL602!__

_We're running Zig bare metal on BL602?_

Not quite. We'll need more work to get Zig talking to __BL602 Hardware__ and printing to the console.

Instead we'll run Zig on top of a __Real-Time Operating System__ (RTOS): [__Apache NuttX__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/nuttx).

_Zig on BL602 should be a piece of cake right?_

Well __Zig on RISC-V__ is kinda newish, and might present interesting new challenges.

In a while I'll explain the strange hack I did to run __Zig on BL602__...

I'm totally new to Zig, please bear with me as I wade through the water and start swimming in Zig! üôè
