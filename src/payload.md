# CBOR Payload Formatter for The Things Network

üìù _24 Oct 2021_

Suppose we have an __IoT Sensor Device__ (like [__PineDio Stack BL604__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/pinedio)) connected to __The Things Network__ (via LoRaWAN)...

-   [__"The Things Network on PineDio Stack BL604 RISC-V Board"__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/ttn)

And our device __transmits Sensor Data__ to The Things Network in __CBOR Format__ (because it requires fewer bytes than JSON)...

-   [__"Encode Sensor Data with CBOR on BL602"__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/cbor)

_What's the best way to process the CBOR Sensor Data transmitted by our device?_

# What's Next

TODO

Today we have turned BL602 and BL604 into a basic __IoT Sensor Device__ that transmits its Internal Temperature to __LoRaWAN and The Things Network__.

In the next article we shall revisit Grafana and The Things Network... And build a better __IoT Monitoring System__ that stores the [__Sensor Data with Prometheus__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/grafana#store-data-with-prometheus).
