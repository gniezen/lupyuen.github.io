Sitronix ST7789 is an SPI Display Controller that's found in many gadgets (including PineTime Smartwatch).

LVGL is a popular open-source library that renders text and graphics on Embedded Devices.

Today we'll use ST7789 Display and LVGL Library on Apache NuttX RTOS (Real-Time Operating System).

NuttX supports ST7789 and LVGL right out of the box. (All batteries included!) So this tutorial should be breezy squeezy peasy.
