__Sitronix ST7789__ is an SPI Display Controller that's found in many gadgets. (Like [__PineTime Smartwatch__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/sneak-peek-of-pinetime-smart-watch-and-why-its-perfect-for-teaching-iot))

[__LVGL__](https://docs.lvgl.io/master/index.html) is a popular Open-Source Library that renders text and graphics on Embedded Devices.

Today we shall run ST7789 Display and LVGL Library on [__Apache NuttX RTOS__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/nuttx) (Real-Time Operating System).

NuttX supports ST7789 and LVGL right __out of the box__. (Batteries all included!) So this tutorial should be breezy squeezy peasy.

We'll run this tutorial on the [__BL602 RISC-V SoC__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/pinecone) and fix some issues specific to BL602...

-   __SPI Send__ didn't work correctly on BL602

-   ST7789 __Data / Command Pin__ wasn't implemented on BL602

-   BL602 only talks __SPI Mode 3__ to ST7789

The same steps should work on __ESP32 and other NuttX Platforms__. (Without the BL602 quirks)
